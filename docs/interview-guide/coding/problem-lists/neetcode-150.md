## Study Strategy

### If You Have 4 Weeks
- Week 1-2: Complete Blind 75
- Week 3-4: Add NeetCode extras

### If You Have 2 Weeks
- Focus on Blind 75 only
- Do NeetCode extras for weak areas

### Priority Order
1. Arrays, Strings, Hash Maps
2. Trees, Graphs
3. Dynamic Programming
4. Everything else

## Key Takeaways

1. **Blind 75 first.** Don't start NeetCode 150 until Blind 75 is solid.
2. **Target weak areas.** Use extras to strengthen specific patterns.
3. **Quality over quantity.** Understanding > memorization.
