# 30-Day Standard: Balanced Preparation

**The most traveled path to offer letters.**

30 days gives you enough time to build real competence without burning out. This plan balances breadth (covering all essential patterns) with depth (understanding how to adapt them).

<TimeEstimate
  learnTime="2-3 hours daily"
  practiceTime="~75 hours total"
  masteryTime="15+ patterns"
  interviewFrequency="Covers ~90% of problems"
  difficultyRange="Comprehensive, manageable"

## If You're Falling Behind

**Prioritize (in order):**
1. Week 1-2 patterns (foundation)
2. Mock interviews (Week 4)
3. Behavioral stories
4. Week 3 advanced patterns
5. System design (if not senior)

**Cut if necessary:**
- Advanced DP variations
- Rare patterns (segment trees, etc.)
- System design deep dives (unless senior+)

<ConfidenceBuilder type="youve-got-this">

**30 days of consistent effort beats 30 years of wishful thinking.**

You're doing the work. Most people never get this far. By Day 30, you'll have seen and practiced the patterns that appear in 90% of interviews.

Trust the process. You've got this.
