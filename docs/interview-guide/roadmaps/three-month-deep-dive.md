# 90-Day Deep Dive: Comprehensive Mastery

**The path to confidence, not just competence.**

Three months gives you time to truly understand patterns, build muscle memory, and develop the intuition that separates good candidates from great ones.

This isn't about cramming—it's about deliberate practice with spaced repetition.

<TimeEstimate
  learnTime="1-2 hours daily"
  practiceTime="~120 hours total"
  masteryTime="25+ patterns"
  interviewFrequency="Covers 95%+ of problems"
  difficultyRange="Comprehensive, thorough"
  prerequisites="Basic programming knowledge"
/>

## Philosophy

**Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.**

In 90 days, you have the luxury of:
- Learning patterns deeply (not just superficially)
- Revisiting problems after forgetting them
- Building genuine understanding (not just pattern matching)
- Developing system design thinking
- Polishing behavioral stories

## For Senior/Staff Roles

Adjust the balance:

| Area | Junior/Mid | Senior | Staff |
|------|------------|--------|-------|
| Coding | 60% | 40% | 30% |
| System Design | 20% | 40% | 50% |
| Behavioral | 20% | 20% | 20% |

**Additional focus for senior+:**
- Leadership scenarios
- Trade-off discussions
- Architecture decisions
- Cross-functional collaboration stories

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Tutorial Hell
Don't just watch solutions. Struggle with problems first.

### 2. Skipping Easy Problems
They build confidence and catch gaps.

### 3. Not Explaining Out Loud
Interview success = thinking + communicating.

### 4. Neglecting Behavioral
Technical skills get you in. Behavioral gets you the offer.

### 5. Cramming Before Interview
Rest is more valuable than last-minute cramming.

## Emergency Acceleration

If your timeline shortens mid-prep:

**8 weeks left?** Focus on:
- Core patterns (Weeks 1-4)
- DP basics (Week 5)
- System design essentials (Week 8)
- Mocks (Week 11)

**4 weeks left?** Switch to:
- [30-Day Standard](/docs/interview-guide/roadmaps/one-month-standard)

**1 week left?** Switch to:
- [7-Day Sprint](/docs/interview-guide/roadmaps/one-week-sprint)

<ConfidenceBuilder type="youve-got-this">

**90 days transforms you.**

By the end of this program, you won't just be prepared—you'll be confident. You'll have seen enough problems that patterns become automatic. You'll have explained enough solutions that communication feels natural.

This is the path to not just getting offers, but choosing between them.

You've got this.
