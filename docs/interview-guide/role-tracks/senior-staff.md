# Senior & Staff Engineer Interviews

Senior+ interviews test depth, breadth, and leadership—not just coding ability.

---

## What's Different

| Aspect | Junior/Mid | Senior | Staff+ |
|--------|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Coding** | Correctness | Optimal + clean | May be lighter |
| **System Design** | Guided | Lead discussion | Architect-level |
| **Scope** | Task | Project | Org/company |
| **Leadership** | Not expected | Expected | Critical |
| **Ambiguity** | Clear requirements | Some ambiguity | High ambiguity |

## Expectations by Level

### Senior Engineer

```
Technical:
- Own complex features end-to-end
- Make sound technical decisions
- Anticipate problems
- Optimize for maintainability

Leadership:
- Mentor junior engineers
- Drive code quality
- Lead technical discussions
- Unblock others
```

### Staff Engineer

```
Technical:
- Set technical direction
- Solve cross-team problems
- Design systems that last years
- Make build vs buy decisions

Leadership:
- Influence without authority
- Align teams on approach
- Drive organizational change
- Develop senior engineers
```

---

## System Design Expectations

### Senior: Depth + Trade-offs

```
- Propose multiple approaches
- Articulate trade-offs clearly
- Handle scale requirements
- Consider operational aspects
- Discuss failure modes
```

### Staff: Architecture + Strategy

```
- Define the problem space
- Consider org constraints
- Design for extensibility
- Multi-year vision
- Migration strategies
- Cross-team dependencies
```

---

## Behavioral Expectations

### Questions You'll Face

```
Senior:
- "Tell me about leading a project"
- "How do you mentor others?"
- "Describe a technical decision you made"

Staff:
- "Tell me about influencing org-wide change"
- "How do you handle disagreement with leadership?"
- "Describe setting technical direction"
- "How do you balance competing priorities?"
```

### What They Look For

```
Senior:
✓ Takes ownership
✓ Thinks beyond immediate task
✓ Helps others grow
✓ Communicates clearly

Staff:
✓ Thinks strategically
✓ Influences across teams
✓ Navigates ambiguity
✓ Balances short/long term
✓ Develops senior engineers
```

---

## Technical Deep Dives

Staff interviews often include deep dives:

```
"Tell me about a system you designed"

Expected depth:
- Why those requirements?
- What alternatives considered?
- What trade-offs made?
- How did it evolve?
- What would you do differently?
- How did you get buy-in?
- How did you handle disagreements?
```

---

## Coding Expectations

### Senior

```
- Optimal solutions expected
- Clean, production-quality code
- Discuss edge cases thoroughly
- Testing strategy
```

### Staff

```
- May have lighter coding
- Focus on approach over syntax
- System-level thinking
- API design questions
```

---

## Red Flags at Senior/Staff

```
✗ Can't discuss trade-offs
✗ Only one solution
✗ Doesn't mention others/team
✗ Can't handle ambiguity
✗ No examples of influence
✗ Can't zoom in AND out
✗ Blame others for failures
```

---

## Preparation Strategy

### For Senior

```
1. Master 3-4 system design case studies
2. Prepare 10+ behavioral stories (STAR)
3. Practice explaining technical decisions
4. LeetCode medium/hard (100+ problems)
```

### For Staff

```
1. Deep expertise in 2-3 system designs
2. Prepare stories of org-level impact
3. Practice articulating technical vision
4. Prepare cross-team collaboration examples
5. Have opinions on industry trends
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Scope increases** with level—think beyond your code.
2. **Leadership is expected** even without reports.
3. **Influence matters** more than implementation.
4. **Trade-off discussions** are crucial.
5. **Have strong opinions** loosely held.
