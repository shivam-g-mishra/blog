## Red Flags to Avoid

| Don't | Do Instead |
|-------|------------|
| Badmouth former employers | Focus on what you learned |
| Say "I don't know" and stop | Say "I'd approach it by..." |
| Interrupt the interviewer | Listen fully, then respond |
| Rush to code | Clarify first |
| Argue with feedback | Thank them for the perspective |
| Ask about salary first | Wait until they bring it up |

---

## Questions to Ask

Have 3-5 thoughtful questions ready:

```
About the role:
- "What does success look like in 6 months?"
- "What are the biggest challenges facing the team?"

About the team:
- "How does the team handle code reviews?"
- "What's the on-call rotation like?"

About growth:
- "How do you support career development?"
- "What's the path to [senior/staff]?"
```

---

## After Each Round

```
□ Thank the interviewer
□ Note any follow-up items
□ Don't dwell on mistakes
□ Reset mentally for next round
□ Use restroom/water breaks
```

---

## After the Interview

```
Same day:
□ Send thank-you emails (brief, personal)
□ Note what went well and poorly
□ Don't obsess or over-analyze

While waiting:
□ Continue applying elsewhere
□ Follow up after 1 week if no response
□ Prepare for potential next rounds
```

---

## Managing Nerves

```
If anxious:
- Deep breaths (4 in, 4 hold, 4 out)
- Power pose for 2 minutes before
- Remind yourself: they want you to succeed
- Reframe: "I'm excited" vs "I'm nervous"

If stuck on a problem:
- Say "Let me think for a moment"
- Write out what you know
- Ask clarifying questions
- Try a simpler version first
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Sleep > last-minute cramming.**
2. **Arrive early.** Being rushed amplifies nerves.
3. **Clarify before coding.** Always.
4. **Talk through your thinking.** Silence is the enemy.
5. **Ask good questions.** Shows genuine interest.
6. **It's a conversation.** They want you to succeed.
