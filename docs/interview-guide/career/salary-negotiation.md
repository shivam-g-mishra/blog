# Salary Negotiation: Get What You're Worth

Most people don't negotiate. Those who do typically get 10-20% more. That's $15K-50K+ over a few minutes of conversation.

---

## Understand Total Compensation

### Components

```
Total Compensation = Base Salary + Bonus + Equity + Benefits

Example (L5 at Big Tech):
Base:         $200,000
Bonus:         $40,000 (20% target)
Equity:       $100,000/year (4-year vest)
─────────────────────────
Total:        $340,000/year
```

### What's Negotiable

| Component | Negotiable? | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Base salary | Yes | Usually within band |
| Signing bonus | Very | Often flexible |
| Equity/RSUs | Yes | Especially refreshers |
| Annual bonus | Somewhat | Target % usually fixed |
| Start date | Yes | Can affect signing bonus |
| Level | Sometimes | If borderline |
| PTO | Rarely | Usually policy-based |
| Remote work | Sometimes | Depends on company |

## Research First

### Know Your Numbers

```
Before negotiating, research:
1. Market rate for role + level + location
2. Company's typical comp bands
3. Your competing offers (if any)

Sources:
- levels.fyi
- Glassdoor
- Blind
- LinkedIn salary insights
- Competing offers
```

### Know Your Value

```
Be ready to articulate:
- Specific skills in demand
- Relevant experience
- Competing offers
- Cost of leaving current job
```

## The Negotiation Script

### When They Give the Number

```
Recruiter: "We're offering $180K base, $50K signing, and $200K equity 
over 4 years. How does that sound?"

You: "Thank you for the offer. I'm really excited about the 
opportunity at [Company]. I'd like to take some time to review 
the full package. Can you send the details in writing?"

[Get everything in writing first]
```

### Making the Ask

```
You: "I've reviewed the offer and I'm very excited about joining. 
Based on my research and competing offers, I was hoping for a base 
closer to $210K. Is there flexibility there?"

[Specific number, not a range]
[Provide justification]
```

### If They Say No

```
Recruiter: "Unfortunately, $180K is the top of the band for this level."

You: "I understand base may be constrained. Would you be able to 
increase the signing bonus to help bridge the gap? I'm also happy 
to discuss equity as an alternative."

[Pivot to other components]
```

### If They Push Back

```
Recruiter: "Why do you feel you deserve more?"

You: "A few reasons: First, I have [specific experience] that's 
directly relevant. Second, I have a competing offer at $X. 
Third, market data from levels.fyi shows this role typically 
pays $Y in this location."

[Have concrete justifications ready]
```

---

## Negotiation Tactics

### Always Get Multiple Offers

```
Multiple offers = leverage

Even if you prefer Company A:
- Interview at Company B and C
- Use competing offers to negotiate
- "I have an offer from [Company] at $X. Can you match?"
```

### Never Give a Number First

```
Recruiter: "What are your salary expectations?"

You: "I'm focused on finding the right role. I'm confident we can 
agree on fair compensation if this is a good fit. What's the 
range for this position?"

[Deflect back to them]
```

### Use Email for Initial Negotiation

```
Benefits of email:
- Time to think
- Written record
- Less pressure
- Can craft response carefully
```

### Don't Negotiate Against Yourself

```
Wrong: "I was hoping for $200K, but I could do $190K."

Right: "I was hoping for $200K."

[State your number and stop talking]
```

## Sample Negotiation Email

```
Subject: Re: Offer for Senior Software Engineer

Hi [Recruiter],

Thank you so much for the offer. I'm very excited about joining 
[Company] and contributing to [specific project/team].

After reviewing the package and consulting with my family, I'd like 
to discuss a few points:

1. Base salary: Based on my research and a competing offer, I was 
   hoping for a base closer to $210K. My experience with [specific 
   skill] and track record of [specific achievement] position me 
   well to make an immediate impact.

2. Signing bonus: Given [reason - relocation/competing offer/unvested 
   equity], would you be able to increase the signing bonus to $80K?

I want to emphasize that I'm very excited about this opportunity and 
confident we can find an agreement that works for both sides.

Best,
[Your name]
```
