Your resume has 6 seconds to make an impression. Make them count.

## Format Rules

### One Page

Unless you have 10+ years of highly relevant experience, keep it to one page.

### Clean Layout

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  NAME                                          Contact Info    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  EXPERIENCE                                                     │
│  Company - Title (Date - Date)                                 │
│  • Achievement with metrics                                    │
│  • Achievement with metrics                                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  PROJECTS (if early career)                                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  SKILLS                                                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  EDUCATION                                                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### ATS-Friendly

- No tables, columns, or graphics
- Standard section headers
- PDF format
- No headers/footers

---

## Content Rules

### Use Action Verbs

```
✓ Designed, Implemented, Led, Reduced, Increased, Built, Migrated
✗ Responsible for, Helped with, Worked on
```

### Quantify Everything

```
✗ "Improved system performance"
✓ "Reduced API latency by 40% (200ms → 120ms) by implementing Redis caching"

✗ "Led a team"
✓ "Led team of 5 engineers to deliver payment system 2 weeks ahead of schedule"
```

### STAR Format for Bullets

```
Situation/Task + Action + Result

"Redesigned authentication system [what] using OAuth 2.0 [how], 
reducing login failures by 60% and improving security audit score 
from B to A [result]"
```

---

## Experience Section

### Format

```
COMPANY NAME — City, State
Job Title                                          Start Date – End Date

• [Action verb] + [What you did] + [Technology/method] + [Quantified result]
• [Action verb] + [What you did] + [Technology/method] + [Quantified result]
• [Action verb] + [What you did] + [Technology/method] + [Quantified result]
```

### Example

```

Senior Software Engineer                           Jan 2022 – Present

• Designed and implemented distributed rate limiting service using Go and 
  Redis, handling 10M requests/second with 99.99% availability
• Led migration from monolith to microservices architecture, reducing 
  deployment time from 4 hours to 15 minutes
• Mentored 3 junior engineers through code reviews and pair programming, 
  resulting in 2 promotions

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| No metrics | Add numbers to every bullet |
| Duties, not achievements | Focus on impact |
| Too long | Cut to one page |
| Typos | Proofread 3 times |
| Generic | Tailor to each job |
| Objective statement | Remove it |
| References | Don't include |

---

## Keywords

Include relevant keywords from the job description:

```
Job posting mentions:
- Microservices
- AWS
- Python
- System design
- Agile

Your resume should include these exact terms if you have experience.
```
