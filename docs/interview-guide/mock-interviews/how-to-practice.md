# Mock Interviews: Practice Like the Real Thing

Mock interviews are the closest you can get to real interview pressure. Don't skip them.

---

## Why Mock Interviews Matter

```
Reading about swimming ≠ Swimming
Solving problems alone ≠ Solving under pressure

Mock interviews practice:
- Thinking out loud
- Time management
- Handling nerves
- Whiteboard/screen sharing
- Receiving feedback
```

## Structuring a Mock Session

### Before (5 min)

```
- Agree on format (coding, system design, behavioral)
- Set time limit (45-60 min for coding)
- Interviewer prepares question
- Interviewee clears workspace
```

### During

```
Interviewer:
- Present problem clearly
- Give hints if stuck (after appropriate struggle)
- Note communication, approach, code quality
- Track time

Interviewee:
- Ask clarifying questions
- Think out loud
- Write clean code
- Test solution
```

### After (15 min)

```
Feedback session:
1. What went well
2. What could improve
3. Specific examples
4. Actionable advice

Then switch roles (if applicable)
```

## Giving Good Feedback

### Be Specific

```
✗ "Your code was messy"
✓ "Variable names like 'x' and 'temp' made it hard 
   to follow. Consider 'currentSum' instead"

✗ "You were too slow"
✓ "You spent 10 minutes on clarification. Try to 
   get to coding within 5 minutes"
```

### Cover All Aspects

```
Feedback checklist:
□ Problem understanding
□ Approach/algorithm choice
□ Communication
□ Code quality
□ Testing
□ Time management
□ Handling hints
```

---

## Receiving Feedback

```
Do:
- Listen without defending
- Take notes
- Ask for clarification
- Thank them genuinely

Don't:
- Explain why you made mistakes
- Get defensive
- Dismiss feedback
- Argue about the "right" answer
```

---

## Frequency

```
Minimum: 1 mock per week during active prep
Optimal: 2-3 mocks per week

Last week before interviews:
- 1 mock per day
- Focus on weak areas
```

---

## Self-Recording

```
If no partner available:

1. Record yourself solving problems
2. Watch with critical eye
3. Note:
   - Awkward silences
   - Unclear explanations
   - Time spent on each phase

Tools: Loom, OBS, Zoom (record yourself)
```
