# Conflict Resolution: Disagreement Questions

Every interviewer asks about conflicts. They want to see maturity, communication skills, and growth.

---

## Why They Ask

Interviewers want to know:
- Can you work with others?
- How do you handle disagreement professionally?
- Do you take feedback well?
- Can you give difficult feedback?
- Do you hold grudges?

---

## Common Questions

1. "Tell me about a time you disagreed with your manager"
2. "Describe a conflict with a coworker"
3. "Tell me about receiving critical feedback"
4. "How do you handle disagreement in code review?"
5. "Describe a time your idea was rejected"

---

## Framework: STAR + Resolution

```
Situation: Brief context
Task: Your role and the conflict
Action: How you handled it professionally
Result: Positive outcome
Reflection: What you learned
```

## Example: Disagreement with Manager

**Question:** "Tell me about a time you disagreed with your manager"

```
Situation:
"My manager wanted to skip writing tests for a new feature 
to meet a deadline."

Task:
"I believed this would cause problems long-term and wanted 
to find a middle ground."

Action:
"I asked for a private conversation. I acknowledged the 
deadline pressure, then shared data: our last rushed 
feature had 3 production incidents. I proposed writing 
tests for the critical path (60% coverage) instead of 
our usual 90%, cutting test time in half."

Result:
"My manager appreciated the compromise. We met the deadline 
with targeted tests. The feature launched with zero incidents."

Reflection:
"I learned that coming with solutions, not just objections, 
makes disagreement productive."
```

## Example: Code Review Conflict

**Question:** "How do you handle disagreement in code review?"

```
Situation:
"A senior engineer repeatedly blocked my PRs with style 
preferences not in our guidelines."

Task:
"I needed to get my work merged while maintaining a good 
relationship."

Action:
"First, I made all changes that were clearly improvements. 
For the subjective ones, I added comments explaining my 
reasoning. When we still disagreed, I suggested a 10-minute 
call. On the call, I said 'Help me understand your concern' 
rather than defending my approach."

Result:
"We found he'd been burned by similar code in the past. 
We agreed to add a guideline for future reference. My PR 
was merged, and he became a helpful reviewer."

Reflection:
"Understanding the 'why' behind feedback often reveals 
legitimate concerns."
```

---

## Example: Receiving Critical Feedback

**Question:** "Tell me about receiving difficult feedback"

```
Situation:
"In my first performance review, I was told my communication 
in meetings was too aggressive."

Task:
"I needed to understand and address this blind spot."

Action:
"My first reaction was defensive, but I asked for specific 
examples. My manager mentioned I interrupted others and 
dismissed ideas quickly. I thanked him for the feedback and 
asked for ongoing signals. I started waiting 3 seconds 
before responding in meetings and saying 'That's interesting, 
tell me more' before critiquing."

Result:
"Six months later, feedback surveys showed significant 
improvement. A colleague thanked me for being more 
collaborative."

Reflection:
"Specific feedback is a gift. The discomfort of hearing it 
is worth the growth."
```

## What NOT to Say

| Red Flag | Why It's Bad |
|----------|--------------|
| "I've never had conflicts" | Unbelievable, suggests avoidance |
| "My coworker was wrong" | One-sided, no self-awareness |
| "I just did what they said" | Pushover, no backbone |
| "I escalated to their manager" | First resort = bad judgment |
| Still sounds angry | Haven't moved past it |

---

## Key Phrases to Use

```
Opening conflict constructively:
- "I wanted to understand their perspective"
- "I asked to discuss privately"
- "I acknowledged their valid points first"

During conflict:
- "Help me understand..."
- "What if we tried..."
- "I see your concern about X, and..."

After resolution:
- "We found common ground"
- "I learned that..."
- "Our relationship improved"
```

## Prepare 2-3 Stories

| Story Type | Example |
|------------|---------|
| Technical disagreement | Architecture decision |
| Process disagreement | Sprint planning, deadlines |
| Interpersonal conflict | Working style differences |
| Feedback you received | Performance review |
| Feedback you gave | Mentoring, code review |
