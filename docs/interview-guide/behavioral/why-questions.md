# Why Questions: Show Your Motivation

"Why us?" questions are almost guaranteed. A thoughtful answer sets you apart.

---

## Why They Ask

```
They want to know:
- Is this candidate serious about us specifically?
- Did they do their research?
- Will they accept an offer?
- Will they stay?
- Are they genuinely excited?
```

## "Why This Company?"

### The Formula

```
1. Specific reason about the company
2. How it aligns with your goals/values
3. What you'll bring

Bad: "It's a great company with good culture"
Good: "Three reasons specifically..."
```

### Strong Answer Example

```
"Three things drew me to [Company]:

First, [specific product/initiative]. I've used [product] for 
years and was impressed by [specific feature]. I'd love to 
contribute to that.

Second, [technical/cultural aspect]. Your engineering blog 
on [topic] showed a commitment to [value] that matches how 
I like to work.

Third, the growth trajectory. [Recent news/development] 
suggests this is a pivotal time, and I want to be part 
of that journey.

My background in [X] could help with [Y challenge they have]."
```

### Research Topics

```
Before the interview, know:
- Recent news and announcements
- Products and their differentiators
- Engineering blog posts
- Company values/mission
- Key challenges they're solving
- Competitors and market position
- Team you'd join
```

## "Why This Role?"

### The Formula

```
1. How it fits your career goals
2. Why you're qualified
3. What excites you about the work
```

### Strong Answer Example

```
"This role excites me for a few reasons:

First, it's the natural next step in my career. I've spent 
3 years building [X], and this role lets me apply that at 
larger scale.

Second, the problem space. [Specific challenge in the role] 
is exactly what I've been wanting to tackle. I think about 
[related problem] even in my spare time.

Third, the team. From talking with [recruiter/interviewer], 
it seems like a group I'd learn a lot from and contribute 
meaningfully to."

## "Why Are You Leaving Your Current Job?"

### Dos and Don'ts

```
Do:
- Focus on what you're moving toward
- Be honest but diplomatic
- Show growth orientation

Don't:
- Badmouth current employer
- Say only "more money"
- Be vague or evasive
```

### Strong Answers

```
Growth: "I've learned a lot, but I'm ready for [bigger 
scope/new challenge] that isn't available in my current role."

Skills: "I want to work more on [technology/domain], and 
this role focuses on exactly that."

Impact: "I'm looking to work on problems that affect more 
users/have larger scale."

Team/Culture: "I'm seeking a more collaborative environment 
where I can learn from experienced engineers."
```

## "Where Do You See Yourself in 5 Years?"

### Good Approach

```
Show ambition + alignment with company:

"In 5 years, I see myself as a senior/staff engineer 
leading technical initiatives. I want to grow both 
technically deep and in my ability to influence across 
teams. [Company]'s ladder and emphasis on [value] seems 
like a great place to develop those skills."
```

### Avoid

```
✗ "In your chair" (arrogant)
✗ "Running my own startup" (flight risk)
✗ "I don't know" (no ambition)
✗ Unrelated goals (misalignment)
```

## Red Flags to Avoid

| Don't Say | Why It's Bad |
|-----------|--------------|
| "I'll take any job" | Shows desperation, not fit |
| "The salary" only | Seems transactional |
| Generic praise | Didn't do research |
| Bad-mouthing others | Reflects poorly on you |
| "Stepping stone" | Won't stay |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Be specific.** Generic answers = generic candidate.
2. **Research deeply.** Know products, values, recent news.
3. **Connect to your story.** Why does this fit YOUR goals?
4. **Show enthusiasm.** Energy matters.
5. **Never badmouth.** Focus on moving toward, not away from.
