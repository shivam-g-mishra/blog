## Why They Ask

| What They Want to Know | Why It Matters |
|------------------------|----------------|
| **Is this candidate serious about us?** | Generic candidates waste interview slots |
| **Did they research us?** | Research shows initiative and interest |
| **Will they accept an offer?** | Offers are expensive; they want acceptances |
| **Will they stay?** | Hiring costs money; retention matters |
| **Are they genuinely excited?** | Excited employees perform better |

## "Why This Company?"

### The Formula

```
1. Specific reason about the company (shows research)
2. How it aligns with YOUR goals/values (shows fit)
3. What YOU bring (shows value proposition)
```

### Weak vs. Strong Answers

**Weak answer:**
> "It's a great company with good culture and interesting problems."

**Why it's weak:** Could apply to any company. Shows no research.

**Strong answer:**
> "Three things specifically draw me to [Company]:
>
> First, your [specific product/initiative]. I've been using [product] for two years and was impressed by [specific feature]. The engineering decisions behind [technical aspect] show a commitment to [value] that I share.
>
> Second, your engineering culture. I read your blog post on [specific topic] and it resonated with how I like to work—[specific connection to your experience].
>
> Third, the timing. [Recent news/development] suggests this is a pivotal moment for [Company], and I want to contribute to that growth.
>
> My background in [X] positions me well to help with [Y challenge you know they have]."

### Research Checklist

Before every interview, know:

| Category | Research Points |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Products** | What they build, differentiators, who uses them |
| **Technical** | Tech stack, engineering blog posts, open source |
| **Business** | Revenue model, competitors, market position |
| **Culture** | Values, mission, how they describe themselves |
| **News** | Recent announcements, funding, launches |
| **Team** | Who you'd work with, team structure |
| **Challenges** | Problems they're solving, growth areas |

### Where to Research

- Company website (About, Careers, Blog)
- Engineering blog
- LinkedIn (company page, employees)
- Glassdoor (reviews, interview experiences)
- News articles (TechCrunch, company announcements)
- Their products (actually use them)
- GitHub (if they have open source)
- Podcasts/talks by their engineers

## "Why This Role?"

### The Formula

```
1. How it fits your career trajectory
2. Why you're qualified
3. What excites you about the specific work
```

### Full Answer Example

> "This role excites me for three reasons:
>
> First, it's the natural next step in my career. I've spent three years building [type of systems], and this role lets me apply that experience at [larger scale / new domain / higher impact].
>
> Second, the problem space. The challenges you're facing with [specific area mentioned in job description] are exactly what I've been wanting to tackle. I actually think about [related problem] even outside of work.
>
> Third, the growth opportunity. From talking with [recruiter/interviewer], it sounds like this team is [growing / tackling new challenges / at an inflection point]. I want to be part of building something, not just maintaining it."

**Environment:**

### If You Were Laid Off

- Learning from experts
- Specific products you admire
- Career growth opportunities

<ConfidenceBuilder type="youve-got-this" title="Research Is Your Secret Weapon">

**Specific answers require specific research.**

When you reference:
- A blog post they wrote
- A product feature you actually used
- A challenge you know they face
- A value they publicly espouse

...you immediately stand out from candidates giving generic answers.

30 minutes of research can transform "Why this company?" from your weakest to strongest moment.

</ConfidenceBuilder>

## Key Takeaways

1. **Be specific.** Generic answers = generic candidate.

2. **Research deeply.** Know products, values, recent news, technical choices.

3. **Connect to your story.** Why does this fit YOUR career goals?

4. **Focus on moving toward.** Not away from current job.

5. **Show enthusiasm.** Genuine excitement is memorable.

6. **Never badmouth.** Current employer, past employers, anyone.
