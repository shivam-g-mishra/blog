# Failure Questions: Show Growth

Everyone fails. What matters is how you handle it and what you learn.

---

## Why They Ask

```
They want to see:
- Self-awareness (you recognize failures)
- Accountability (you don't blame others)
- Growth mindset (you learn from mistakes)
- Resilience (you bounce back)
```

---

## The Formula

```
1. Describe the failure honestly
2. Own your part (no blaming)
3. Explain what you learned
4. Show how you've applied that learning
```

## Good Failure Story Example

**Question:** "Tell me about a time you failed"

```
Situation:
"I was leading my first major project—a payment system 
migration. I was excited and confident."

What happened:
"I underestimated the complexity of edge cases in our 
legacy system. I gave an aggressive timeline without 
consulting the team or researching thoroughly. We 
missed the deadline by 3 weeks."

My role:
"The failure was mine. I set unrealistic expectations 
without proper discovery. I prioritized looking capable 
over doing thorough analysis."

What I learned:
"Three things: First, always do technical discovery 
before committing to timelines. Second, involve the 
team in estimation—they know the codebase. Third, 
it's better to under-promise and over-deliver."

Applied since:
"On my next project, I built in a 2-week discovery phase. 
I ran estimation poker with the team. We delivered on 
time. I've used this approach ever since."
```

## Technical Failure Example

**Question:** "Tell me about a technical mistake"

```
Situation:
"I pushed a change to production that caused a 2-hour 
outage affecting thousands of users."

What happened:
"I modified a database query to improve performance. 
Tested in staging, looked good. In production, the 
query locked a critical table because of higher 
data volume."

My role:
"I should have load tested with production-scale data. 
I was overconfident because the change seemed simple."

What I learned:
"Never underestimate 'simple' changes in production. 
I now always: run changes through our load testing 
environment, do gradual rollouts, and have rollback 
plans ready."

Applied since:
"I created a pre-production checklist for our team. 
We've had zero outages from query changes since."
```

## What Makes a Good Failure Story

| Do | Don't |
|----|----|
| Take ownership | Blame others or circumstances |
| Show specific learning | Give vague lessons |
| Demonstrate change | Just say "I learned a lot" |
| Be honest | Disguise success as failure |
| Show impact | Minimize the failure |

---

## Choosing the Right Failure

```
Good failure stories:
✓ You were genuinely responsible
✓ Stakes were real (not trivial)
✓ Clear lesson learned
✓ You've demonstrably improved
✓ Happened 1-3 years ago

Avoid:
✗ Failures from yesterday (too raw)
✗ Character flaws ("I'm too honest")
✗ Blaming others
✗ No real consequences
✗ No actual learning
```

## Common Questions

1. "Tell me about a time you failed"
2. "Describe a mistake you made"
3. "Tell me about a project that didn't go well"
4. "What's your biggest professional regret?"
5. "Tell me about a time you received critical feedback"

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Own it completely.** No excuses or blame.
2. **Be specific** about what went wrong.
3. **Show concrete learning.** Not just "I learned a lot."
4. **Demonstrate change.** How are you different now?
5. **Pick meaningful failures.** Trivial ≠ humble.
