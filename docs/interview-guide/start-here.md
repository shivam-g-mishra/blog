# Start Here: Find Your Path

**You're going to be okay.**

Whether you have 7 days or 3 months, whether you're a new grad or a senior engineer, there's a path for you. This guide has helped thousands of engineers land offers at top companies.

Let's figure out where you should start.

## Quick Assessment

### How much time do you have?

| Timeline | Best Path |
|----------|-----------|
| **1 week or less** | [7-Day Sprint](/docs/interview-guide/roadmaps/one-week-sprint) — Focus on highest-impact patterns |
| **2-4 weeks** | [30-Day Standard](/docs/interview-guide/roadmaps/one-month-standard) — Balanced preparation |
| **1-3 months** | [90-Day Deep Dive](/docs/interview-guide/roadmaps/three-month-deep-dive) — Comprehensive mastery |
| **Just exploring** | [Patterns Overview](/docs/interview-guide/patterns-overview) — See all patterns at a glance |

### What's your experience level?

| Level | Focus Areas |
|-------|-------------|
| **New Grad / Junior** | Data structures → Core patterns → Behavioral basics |
| **Mid-Level (2-5 years)** | Patterns mastery → System design intro → Behavioral depth |
| **Senior (5+ years)** | System design focus → Leadership behavioral → Advanced patterns |
| **Staff+** | System design deep dive → Cross-functional scenarios → Architecture |

### What interview type are you preparing for?

| Interview Type | Primary Resources |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **Coding-heavy** (most tech) | [Coding Patterns](/docs/interview-guide/coding/patterns) |
| **System Design-heavy** (senior+) | [System Design](/docs/interview-guide/system-design/fundamentals/introduction) |
| **Behavioral-heavy** (Amazon, leadership) | [Behavioral Guide](/docs/interview-guide/behavioral/introduction) |
| **Full loop** (all of the above) | [30-Day Roadmap](/docs/interview-guide/roadmaps/one-month-standard) |

## Recommended Starting Points

### If you're feeling overwhelmed...

Start with the [Confidence Zone](/docs/interview-guide/confidence-zone). Interview anxiety is real, and managing it is as important as technical preparation.

**Then:** Pick ONE pattern and master it completely before moving on.

### If you're rusty on fundamentals...

Start with [Data Structures](/docs/interview-guide/coding/data-structures/arrays-strings). Refresh your memory on the building blocks before tackling patterns.

**Sequence:** Arrays → Hash Tables → Trees → Graphs

### If you're short on time...

Go directly to the [7-Day Sprint](/docs/interview-guide/roadmaps/one-week-sprint). It prioritizes the patterns that appear most frequently in interviews.

**Focus on:** Two Pointers, Sliding Window, BFS/DFS, Binary Search

### If you're preparing for a specific company...

Check the [Company Guides](/docs/interview-guide/company-guides/amazon):
- [Amazon](/docs/interview-guide/company-guides/amazon) — LP-heavy, bar raiser process
- [Google](/docs/interview-guide/company-guides/google) — Algorithm focus, Googleyness
- [Meta](/docs/interview-guide/company-guides/meta) — Fast-paced, practical problems
- [Microsoft](/docs/interview-guide/company-guides/microsoft) — Well-rounded, growth mindset
- [Apple](/docs/interview-guide/company-guides/apple) — Secrecy, technical depth

## The 80/20 of Interview Prep

**80% of interview problems come from 20% of patterns.**

If you learn nothing else, master these:

| Pattern | Frequency | Time to Learn |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| [Two Pointers](/docs/interview-guide/coding/patterns/array-patterns/two-pointers) | Very High | 2-3 hours |
| [Sliding Window](/docs/interview-guide/coding/patterns/array-patterns/sliding-window) | Very High | 2-3 hours |
| [BFS/DFS](/docs/interview-guide/coding/patterns/graph-patterns/traversal) | Very High | 3-4 hours |
| [Binary Search](/docs/interview-guide/coding/patterns/search-patterns/binary-search) | High | 2-3 hours |
| [Dynamic Programming](/docs/interview-guide/coding/patterns/dp-patterns/introduction) | High | 4-6 hours |
| [Backtracking](/docs/interview-guide/coding/patterns/backtracking-patterns/introduction) | Medium | 3-4 hours |

**For senior roles, add:**
- [System Design Fundamentals](/docs/interview-guide/system-design/fundamentals/introduction)
- [STAR Method](/docs/interview-guide/behavioral/star-method)

## How to Use This Guide

### 1. Pick a roadmap
Choose based on your timeline. Don't try to do everything.

### 2. Follow the sequence
Each roadmap is ordered intentionally. Trust the process.

### 3. Practice actively
Don't just read—solve problems. Explain out loud. Time yourself.

### 4. Review and repeat
Spaced repetition beats cramming. Revisit patterns after a few days.

### 5. Simulate real conditions
Do mock interviews. Practice with a timer. Code without autocomplete.
