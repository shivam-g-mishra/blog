# Handling Pressure: Stay Calm, Think Clear

Anxiety is normal. Learning to manage it is a skill.

---

## Why We Get Nervous

```
Your brain interprets interviews as threat:
- High stakes (job, money, career)
- Being evaluated
- Unknown questions
- Time pressure

Result: Fight or flight response
- Racing heart
- Sweaty palms
- Mind goes blank
```

---

## Before the Interview

### Physical Preparation

```
Night before:
- Sleep 7-8 hours (non-negotiable)
- Avoid alcohol
- Prepare clothes and equipment

Morning of:
- Eat protein (not sugar)
- Light exercise (walk, stretch)
- Arrive/login early
```

### Mental Preparation

```
Reframe anxiety:
"I'm nervous" → "I'm excited"
Same physical feeling, different interpretation

Remember:
- They want you to succeed
- You've prepared for this
- One interview doesn't define you
```

## In the Moment

### When Anxiety Spikes

```
Physical techniques:
1. Deep breaths (4 in, 4 hold, 4 out)
2. Relax shoulders
3. Unclench jaw
4. Slow down speech

Mental techniques:
1. Focus on the problem, not the stakes
2. "What would I do if this was just practice?"
3. Take a sip of water (buys time)
```

### When Mind Goes Blank

```
Say out loud:
"Let me take a moment to gather my thoughts..."

Then:
1. Re-read the problem
2. Write down what you know
3. Start with a simple example
4. Ask a clarifying question
```

---

## Getting Stuck

### It's Normal

```
Everyone gets stuck. What matters is how you handle it.

Good responses:
- "I'm stuck on [specific part]. Let me try a different approach."
- "Can I get a hint on the direction?"
- "Let me think about what tools might help here..."

Bad responses:
- Panic and freeze
- Guess randomly
- Give up
```

### Recovery Strategies

```
1. Simplify the problem
   "Let me solve a simpler version first..."

2. Work backwards
   "If I had the answer, what would I need?"

3. Try examples
   "Let me trace through another example..."

4. Ask for help
   "I'm stuck on X. Can you point me in a direction?"
```

---

## After a Mistake

```
You will make mistakes. Recovery is key.

In the moment:
"Oh, I see the bug. Let me fix that..."
Don't: Panic, apologize repeatedly, dwell on it

After fixing:
Move on immediately
Don't: Keep mentioning the mistake
```

---

## Between Rounds

```
After each interview:
- Don't replay what went wrong
- Reset mentally ("fresh start")
- Bathroom and water break
- Quick walk if possible
- Deep breaths before next round
```

---

## Long-Term Practice

```
Build stress tolerance:
1. Mock interviews (creates familiarity)
2. Time yourself when practicing
3. Solve problems on whiteboard/screen share
4. Practice with an audience

The more you practice under pressure,
the less pressure you'll feel.
```
