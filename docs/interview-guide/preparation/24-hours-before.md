# 24 Hours Before Your Interview

The night before my first Google interview, I stayed up until 2 AM grinding LeetCode hards.

I walked into that interview exhausted, anxious, and unable to think clearly. I bombed a problem I could have solved half-asleep if I'd actually *been* half-asleep the night before instead of half-awake from no sleep.

**Here's what I wish someone had told me: the 24 hours before your interview isn't about learning more. It's about performing at your best with what you already know.**

Research backs this up. Sleep deprivation impairs cognitive function as much as being legally intoxicated. You wouldn't show up to an interview drunk. Don't show up sleep-deprived either.

This guide is your checklist for the final 24 hours—what to do, what to avoid, and how to walk in feeling confident instead of fried.

## The Night Before

### Logistics Checklist

Get the boring stuff out of the way first. Nothing tanks confidence like scrambling for login links five minutes before your interview starts.

- [ ] **Interview link confirmed** — Test that you can access the video call or IDE
- [ ] **Interviewer names noted** — Know who you're meeting (check LinkedIn)
- [ ] **Time zone verified** — Double-check if it's PT, ET, or your local time
- [ ] **Resume nearby** — Have a copy ready to reference your own projects
- [ ] **Water bottle filled** — You'll want it during the interview
- [ ] **Phone on silent** — Set it now so you don't forget
- [ ] **Backup plan ready** — Have interviewer's email/phone for connection issues

<ConfidenceBuilder type="dont-worry">

**If you forget something, it's okay.** Interviewers are human. If you need to grab water or adjust your setup, just say "Give me one moment" and handle it. Professionalism isn't about being perfect—it's about handling imperfection gracefully.

</ConfidenceBuilder>

### Mental Preparation

This is the part most candidates skip—and it's the part that matters most.

#### Review What You Know (Not What You Don't)

**Solve 2-3 problems you've already solved before.** Not new ones. Problems where you know the pattern, know the solution, and can execute cleanly.

Why? You're building confidence and warming up your problem-solving circuits, not cramming new information.

```
DO: Re-solve Two Sum, Reverse Linked List, Valid Parentheses
DON'T: Attempt a new hard problem you've never seen
```

#### Read Your STAR Stories Once

If you have behavioral interview rounds, read through your prepared stories one time. Don't rehearse them over and over—you want them to sound natural, not scripted.

Focus on remembering:
- The **situation** (context)
- **Your specific actions** (not what the team did)
- The **measurable result**

#### Write Your "I Am Prepared Because..." List

This sounds cheesy. Do it anyway.

Write down 3-5 concrete reasons you're ready for this interview:

> "I'm prepared because:
> 1. I've solved 80+ problems and recognize the core patterns
> 2. I built [project X] which uses similar concepts
> 3. I've practiced explaining my thought process out loud
> 4. I've failed before and learned to recover gracefully"

Keep this list. Read it tomorrow morning.

### What NOT to Do Tonight

These feel productive but hurt your performance:

- [ ] ❌ **No new hard problems after 6 PM** — You won't internalize them, and failure will tank your confidence
- [ ] ❌ **No caffeine after 3 PM** — It affects sleep even if you don't feel it
- [ ] ❌ **No alcohol** — Even one drink reduces sleep quality
- [ ] ❌ **No doom-scrolling interview horror stories** — Nothing good comes from Blind threads at midnight
- [ ] ❌ **No cramming** — Your brain consolidates during sleep, not while staring at code

### Sleep Protocol

This is non-negotiable. Sleep is the single biggest factor in cognitive performance.

**Aim for 7-8 hours.** If you normally get 6, get 6. Don't overcorrect—sleeping 10 hours when you usually sleep 6 can make you groggy.

**Wind-down routine:**
- Dim screens 1 hour before bed (or use night mode)
- Eat a light dinner—avoid heavy, greasy food
- Do something relaxing: read fiction, light stretching, a calm TV show
- Set TWO alarms for tomorrow (on different devices)

<ConfidenceBuilder type="youve-got-this">

**If you can't sleep, don't panic.** Lying in bed resting is still valuable, even without falling asleep. Your body recovers more than you think. One night of imperfect sleep won't ruin you.

## Morning Of

### Physical Preparation

Your body affects your mind. Set yourself up physically.

- [ ] **Wake up at your normal time** — Don't sleep in if you usually don't
- [ ] **Eat a real breakfast** — Protein + complex carbs: eggs, oatmeal, yogurt, fruit
- [ ] **Stay hydrated** — Drink water, not just coffee
- [ ] **Light movement** — A 10-minute walk or stretch gets blood flowing
- [ ] **Use the bathroom** — Before the interview starts, not during
- [ ] **Dress professionally** — Even for remote interviews (it affects your mindset)

**What to eat:**
- ✅ Eggs, oatmeal, Greek yogurt, whole grain toast, fruit
- ✅ Nuts for sustained energy
- ❌ Sugary cereal (crash later)
- ❌ Heavy, greasy food (sluggish)
- ❌ Nothing (hangry brain doesn't code well)

### Mental Warm-Up (30 Minutes Before)

**Do one easy problem.** Not a medium, definitely not a hard. Something like:
- Reverse a string
- Find max in array
- Check if palindrome

This wakes up your coding brain without taxing it. Think of it like stretching before a race.

**Review your "I Am Prepared Because..." list.** Read it out loud if you can.

**5 minutes of deep breathing:**
- Inhale for 4 counts
- Hold for 4 counts
- Exhale for 4 counts
- Repeat 5-10 times

This isn't woo-woo nonsense. It activates your parasympathetic nervous system and reduces cortisol. The science is solid.

### Final Mindset Check

Before you click "Join Meeting," remind yourself:

<ConfidenceBuilder type="remember">

**The interviewer wants you to succeed.**

Empty positions cost companies money. They've spent time and resources getting you to this stage. They're not trying to trick you or watch you fail—they're hoping you're the person they can finally hire.

You're not being judged. You're being evaluated for fit. Those are different things.

</ConfidenceBuilder>

**Affirmations to read (seriously, read these out loud):**
- "I have prepared systematically."
- "I know patterns, not just problems."
- "I can communicate my thinking clearly."
- "Mistakes are normal and I can recover."
- "I've solved hard problems before. I can do it again."

## What If You Didn't Prepare Perfectly?

Maybe you're reading this the morning of your interview. Maybe you did stay up late. Maybe you're feeling anxious anyway.

**That's okay.** Here's your adjusted checklist:

1. **Drink water right now.** Dehydration makes everything worse.
2. **Eat something.** Anything is better than nothing.
3. **Do one easy problem.** Just one. Get your brain in coding mode.
4. **Take 5 deep breaths.** Slow, deliberate.
5. **Remember: communication matters more than perfection.** A candidate who explains a working O(n²) solution clearly often scores higher than one who silently writes buggy O(n) code.

<ConfidenceBuilder type="youve-got-this">

**You've done the preparation. You know more than you think.**

The interviewer isn't looking for perfection. They're looking for someone who can think through problems, communicate clearly, and work well with others.

You can do all of those things. Go show them.
