# Remote Interview Setup Guide

Twenty minutes into my Microsoft interview, my WiFi died.

I was mid-sentence explaining my approach to a graph problem when the video froze. By the time I reconnected (phone hotspot, 3 minutes later), my momentum was gone, my confidence was shaken, and I spent the rest of the interview feeling off-balance.

The frustrating part? This was entirely preventable. I had a backup internet option—I just hadn't tested it or had it ready to go.

**Remote interviews add a layer of complexity that in-person interviews don't have. Technical issues aren't just annoying—they can derail your performance.**

Over 70% of coding interviews happen remotely now. This guide ensures technology works for you, not against you.

## Technical Setup Checklist

Complete this checklist **24 hours before** your interview, not 5 minutes before.

### Internet Connection

- [ ] **Test your connection speed** — Run speedtest.net. You want at least 10 Mbps upload for stable video.
- [ ] **Use wired ethernet if possible** — WiFi is convenient but less reliable
- [ ] **Know your backup plan** — Phone hotspot ready? Neighbor's WiFi password?
- [ ] **Close bandwidth-heavy apps** — Dropbox syncing, cloud backups, streaming

**If you must use WiFi:**
- Sit closer to your router
- Ask family/roommates to avoid streaming during your interview
- Consider a WiFi extender if your signal is weak

### Audio & Video

- [ ] **Test your microphone** — Record yourself speaking. Can you hear clearly?
- [ ] **Test your camera** — Is the lighting on your face (not behind you)?
- [ ] **Use headphones with mic** — Reduces echo and background noise
- [ ] **Position camera at eye level** — Looking down at a laptop camera is unflattering

**Audio quality matters more than video.** If you have to choose, prioritize clear audio over HD video.

### Screen Sharing

- [ ] **Test screen share in advance** — Some platforms need permissions first
- [ ] **Close sensitive tabs/apps** — Browser bookmarks, Slack, personal email
- [ ] **Clean up your desktop** — Remove distracting files and images
- [ ] **Know the keyboard shortcut** — Practice starting/stopping share

**Common screen share platforms and their quirks:**

| Platform | Tips |
|----------|------|
| **Zoom** | Use "Share Screen" → specific window (not entire screen) |
| **Google Meet** | Chrome works best; other browsers can have issues |
| **CoderPad/CodeSignal** | Built-in—no separate sharing needed |
| **Microsoft Teams** | May need admin permission on work computers |

### The Coding Environment

- [ ] **Test the interview platform** — Log in beforehand if you can
- [ ] **Know how to run code** — Where's the "Run" button? How do you see output?
- [ ] **Check language support** — Is your preferred language available?
- [ ] **Familiarize with shortcuts** — Undo, copy/paste, comment/uncomment

**Practice in the actual platform if possible.** CoderPad, HackerRank, and CodeSignal all have free practice modes.

## Environment Setup

Your physical environment affects both your performance and how you're perceived.

### Lighting

- [ ] **Face a window (natural light) or lamp** — Light should be in front of you
- [ ] **Avoid backlighting** — Don't sit with a bright window behind you
- [ ] **Check for shadows** — Your face should be evenly lit
- [ ] **Test at interview time** — Lighting at 2 PM is different from 9 AM

**Quick fix:** A desk lamp positioned behind your laptop, pointing at your face.

### Background

- [ ] **Neutral and uncluttered** — Plain wall, bookshelf, or tidy room
- [ ] **Virtual backgrounds OK** — If your real background is messy, use one
- [ ] **Remove distractions** — No piles of laundry, unmade beds visible
- [ ] **Professional but not sterile** — A plant or bookshelf is fine

### Sound Environment

- [ ] **Quiet room with door closed** — Tell family/roommates your interview time
- [ ] **Silence phone** — Not vibrate. Silent.
- [ ] **Mute desktop notifications** — Slack pings are distracting
- [ ] **Put pets in another room** — Dogs barking is endearing once, annoying twice

<ConfidenceBuilder type="dont-worry">

**Reasonable interruptions won't hurt you.** If a delivery person rings the doorbell once or your cat walks across your keyboard, the interviewer will understand. Just handle it briefly and professionally: "Sorry about that—let me continue where I left off."

## Backup Plan

Things will go wrong. Have a plan for when they do.

### Must-Have Ready

| Backup | Why | How to Prepare |
|--------|-----|----------------|
| **Phone hotspot** | Internet backup | Test it works, know how to enable quickly |
| **Interviewer's email** | Send code if screen share fails | Copy before interview |
| **Phone number** | Audio backup | Have it visible during interview |
| **Alternative device** | Computer crashes | Tablet or phone, logged into platform |

### The Recovery Message

If tech fails, immediately send (via platform chat, email, or text):

> "Technical difficulties on my end—working on reconnecting. Back in 2 minutes."

Then reconnect. Don't spend 10 minutes troubleshooting. Switch to your backup.

**Interviewers generally give 5+ minutes grace for tech issues.** But after that, time does count against your interview.

## Interview Day Protocol

### 30 Minutes Before

- [ ] Close unnecessary applications
- [ ] Open the interview link (but don't join yet)
- [ ] Open a backup text editor
- [ ] Have water within reach
- [ ] Use the bathroom

### 10 Minutes Before

- [ ] Join the waiting room if available
- [ ] Do a final audio/video check
- [ ] Take 5 deep breaths
- [ ] Review your "I am prepared" notes

### 5 Minutes Before

- [ ] Ready to join
- [ ] Posture check—sit up straight
- [ ] Smile—it changes your voice tone
- [ ] Interviewer info visible (their name, role)

## Platform-Specific Tips

### CoderPad (Common for FAANG)

- **Practice mode available** at coderpad.io/sandbox
- Default language is usually changeable
- Output appears in the console below
- Drawing mode available for diagrams
- Interviewer can see your cursor and edits in real-time

### HackerRank (Common for initial screens)

- Often auto-graded—test cases matter
- "Run Code" vs "Submit"—know the difference
- Can't see test case inputs (usually)
- Time limits are enforced

### Google Docs (Still used by some)

- No syntax highlighting
- No running code
- Focus on clarity and communication
- Use consistent indentation

### Excalidraw/Miro (For system design)

- Practice drawing boxes and arrows
- Learn keyboard shortcuts for shapes
- Keep diagrams clean—don't overcrowd

<ConfidenceBuilder type="youve-got-this">

**Preparation eliminates anxiety.**

When you know your setup works, you've tested everything, and you have backups ready, you can focus entirely on the interview—not on worrying about technology.

Do the setup work today. Thank yourself tomorrow.
