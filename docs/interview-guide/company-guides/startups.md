# Startup Interview Guide

Startups interview differently than Big Tech. Less structured, more practical, more focus on impact.

---

## What's Different

| Aspect | Big Tech | Startup |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Structure** | Standardized | Variable |
| **Focus** | Algorithm skills | Practical ability |
| **Process** | 5-6 rounds | 3-4 rounds typical |
| **Timeline** | Weeks | Days to week |
| **Coding** | Whiteboard/online | Often take-home |
| **Questions** | LeetCode style | Real problems |
| **System Design** | Theoretical | Practical constraints |

---

## Typical Process

```
1. Recruiter/Founder Call (30 min)
   └── Culture fit, role overview

2. Technical Screen (60 min)
   └── Coding OR take-home project

3. Onsite / Virtual (3-4 hours)
   ├── Coding / pair programming
   ├── System design / architecture
   └── Team fit / values

4. Founder Chat (30 min)
   └── Vision, expectations
```

## What Startups Look For

### 1. Ownership

```
✓ "I built X from scratch"
✓ "I identified and fixed Y"
✓ "I took initiative to..."

✗ "I was assigned to..."
✗ "My team did..."
```

### 2. Velocity

```
✓ Ship fast, iterate
✓ Bias toward action
✓ Comfortable with ambiguity

✗ Analysis paralysis
✗ Need perfect specs
```

### 3. Breadth

```
✓ Full-stack capability
✓ Can wear multiple hats
✓ Willing to do what's needed

✗ "That's not my job"
✗ Narrow specialization only
```

### 4. Culture Fit

```
✓ Excited about the problem
✓ Team player
✓ Low ego
✓ Honest about unknowns
```

## Take-Home Projects

Many startups use take-homes instead of live coding.

### Tips

```
1. Follow instructions exactly
2. Don't over-engineer
3. Include README with:
   - How to run
   - Design decisions
   - What you'd do with more time
4. Write tests
5. Clean code > clever code
6. Respect the time limit
```

### Sample README Section

```markdown
## Design Decisions

1. **Database choice:** Used PostgreSQL for ACID guarantees 
   since we're handling payments.

2. **API design:** REST over GraphQL for simplicity given 
   the scope.

3. **Trade-offs:** Prioritized code clarity over optimization 
   given the time constraint.

## With More Time

- Add pagination to list endpoints
- Implement caching layer
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Increase test coverage to 90%+
```

## Questions to Ask Startups

### Business
- What's the runway?
- What are the key metrics you track?
- What's the path to profitability?

### Engineering
- What's the tech stack?
- How do you handle technical debt?
- What's the deployment process?

### Culture
- What's a typical day like?
- How are decisions made?
- What happens when things break?

### Role
- What does success look like in 6 months?
- Who would I work with?
- What are the biggest challenges?

## Red Flags

| Red Flag | What It Might Mean |
|----------|-------------------|
| No clear metrics | Lack of focus |
| Vague about runway | Financial trouble |
| "We're like a family" | Boundary issues |
| Can't explain business model | Not viable |
| High turnover | Culture problems |
| No code review | Engineering chaos |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Show ownership.** Startups want self-starters.
2. **Demonstrate breadth.** Be willing to do various tasks.
3. **Research the company.** Know their product, market, competitors.
4. **Ask good questions.** Due diligence matters.
5. **Move fast.** Startup hiring is quick—respond promptly.
