# Meta Interview Guide

Meta (formerly Facebook) emphasizes coding heavily. They want people who can ship fast.

---

## Interview Process

```
1. Recruiter Screen (30 min)
   └── Background, role fit

2. Technical Phone Screen (45 min)
   └── 2 coding problems

3. Onsite (4-5 rounds)
   ├── Coding × 2 (45 min each, 2 problems per round)
   ├── System Design × 1 (E5+)
   └── Behavioral × 1 (less structured than Amazon)
```

## Meta Values

| Value | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **Move Fast** | Bias toward shipping |
| **Be Bold** | Take risks |
| **Focus on Impact** | Prioritize what matters |
| **Be Open** | Transparent communication |
| **Build Social Value** | Mission-driven |

## Coding Expectations

### Speed Matters

Meta expects faster coding than Google:
- 2 problems in 45 minutes
- Less time for discussion
- Working code expected

### Focus Areas

| High Priority | Medium Priority |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Arrays/Strings | Trees |
| Hash Maps | Graphs |
| Two Pointers | Binary Search |
| Recursion | Dynamic Programming |

### Common Problems
- Valid Palindrome
- Merge Intervals
- Binary Tree traversals
- Subarray Sum Equals K
- LRU Cache

## System Design (E5+)

### What They Look For
- **Product sense:** How would users use this?
- **Scale thinking:** Billions of users
- **Trade-offs:** Clear pros/cons
- **Depth in your area:** Go deep somewhere

### Common Questions
- Design Facebook News Feed
- Design Instagram
- Design Messenger
- Design Facebook Live
- Design Ad Ranking System

## Behavioral

Less formal than Amazon, but still important:

- "Why Meta?"
- "Tell me about a challenging project"
- "How do you handle disagreements?"
- "Describe your biggest impact"

**Tip:** Tie answers to Meta values (move fast, impact, etc.)

## Level Expectations

| Level | Coding | System Design | Experience |
|-------|--------|---------------|------------|
| E3 | Must pass | None | New grad |
| E4 | Must pass | Basic | 2-4 years |
| E5 | Strong | Required | 5+ years |
| E6 | Strong | Deep | 8+ years |

## Preparation Tips

### Coding
1. **Practice speed:** Use timer, 20 min per medium
2. **Think out loud:** Constant communication
3. **Test your code:** Walk through examples
4. **Handle edge cases:** Empty input, single element

### System Design
1. **Know Meta products:** News Feed, Messenger, Instagram
2. **Scale numbers:** Billions of users, millions QPS
3. **Real-time focus:** Notifications, feeds, messaging

1. **Coding is heavily weighted.** More problems, faster pace.
2. **2 problems per round.** Practice speed.
3. **System design at E5+.** Focus on Meta-scale products.
4. **Move fast mentality.** They want builders who ship.
