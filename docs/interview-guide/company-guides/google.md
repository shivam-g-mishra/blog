# Google Interview Guide

Google's interview is legendary for a reason. High bar, algorithmic focus, and the mysterious "Googleyness" factor.

---

## Interview Process

```
1. Recruiter Screen (30 min)
   └── Background, motivation, logistics

2. Phone/Video Screen (45 min)
   └── 1-2 coding problems, Google Meet + shared doc

3. Onsite (4-5 rounds, ~45 min each)
   ├── Coding × 2-3
   ├── System Design × 1 (L5+)
   └── Googleyness & Leadership × 1

4. Hiring Committee Review
   └── Packet review by independent committee

5. Team Matching
   └── After HC approval
```

## What Google Looks For

### Coding

- **Algorithm mastery:** Medium-hard LeetCode level
- **Clean code:** Readable, well-structured
- **Communication:** Think out loud, explain approach
- **Testing:** Edge cases, validate solution

### System Design (L5+)

- **Scalability thinking:** Handle millions of users
- **Trade-off discussions:** Articulate pros/cons
- **Breadth + Depth:** Know basics well, go deep somewhere

### Googleyness

- **Intellectual humility:** Admit what you don't know
- **Collaborative:** Work well with others
- **Comfortable with ambiguity:** Handle unclear problems
- **Bias toward action:** Get things done

---

## Coding Focus Areas

### High Priority
- Trees and Graphs (BFS, DFS, shortest path)
- Dynamic Programming
- String manipulation
- Arrays and Hash Maps

### Medium Priority
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Binary Search variations
- Sliding Window
- Two Pointers

### Lower Priority (but can appear)
- Bit manipulation
- Tries
- Union-Find

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Jumping to code too fast:** Clarify first
2. **Silent thinking:** Keep talking
3. **Not testing:** Walk through examples
4. **Giving up:** Ask for hints if stuck

---

## Sample Questions

### Coding
- Find all paths from source to target in a graph
- Design a data structure for snapshot array
- Word ladder transformation
- Meeting rooms scheduling

### System Design (L5+)
- Design Google Drive
- Design YouTube
- Design Google Maps
- Design Gmail

### Googleyness
- "Tell me about a time you disagreed with a teammate"
- "Describe a situation where you had to learn something new quickly"
- "How do you handle ambiguous requirements?"

---

## Preparation Timeline

### 2 Months Before
- Start Blind 75
- Review data structures
- Read system design basics (if L5+)

### 1 Month Before
- Complete Blind 75
- Practice explaining solutions
- Mock interviews

### 1 Week Before
- Light practice (don't cram)
- Review behavioral stories
- Rest and prepare mentally

## Key Takeaways

1. **Algorithms are king.** Google is the most algorithm-heavy of FAANG.
2. **Communication matters.** Think out loud constantly.
3. **Googleyness is real.** Be humble, collaborative, and curious.
4. **Hiring committee decides.** Interviewers recommend, committee approves.
