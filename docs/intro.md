# Welcome to My Docs

This documentation section contains in-depth guides, tutorials, and reference materials on topics I work with daily. The content is organized into focused areas, each with comprehensive guides you can follow step-by-step.

## What You'll Find Here

### Observability

Complete guides to building production-grade observability systems. Start with the fundamentals, then dive into language-specific instrumentation guides for **Go**, **Python**, **Java**, **C#/.NET**, and **Node.js**.

- [Introduction to Observability](/docs/observability/introduction) — Why observability matters
- [The Three Pillars](/docs/observability/three-pillars) — Logs, metrics, and traces explained
- [Understanding OpenTelemetry](/docs/observability/opentelemetry) — The vendor-neutral standard
- [Language Integrations](/docs/observability/integrations/overview) — Step-by-step instrumentation guides

### Infrastructure & CI/CD

Kubernetes deployment patterns and CI/CD pipeline architectures.

- [Kubernetes Basics](/docs/infrastructure/kubernetes-basics) — Core concepts and patterns
- [CI/CD Patterns](/docs/infrastructure/ci-cd-patterns) — Pipeline design and best practices

### Development

Modern development practices and language-specific patterns.

- [API Design](/docs/development/api-design) — RESTful API principles
- [React Patterns](/docs/development/react-patterns) — Component patterns and optimization
- [TypeScript Tips](/docs/development/typescript-tips) — Advanced types and patterns

### Best Practices

Guidelines for code quality, testing, and documentation.

- [Code Review](/docs/best-practices/code-review) — Review guidelines and checklists
- [Testing Strategies](/docs/best-practices/testing-strategies) — Unit, integration, and E2E testing
- [Documentation](/docs/best-practices/documentation) — Writing effective technical docs

## Getting Started

If you're new here, I'd recommend starting with **Observability** — it's the most comprehensive section and provides practical, hands-on guidance you can apply immediately. The [instrumentation blog post](/blog/instrumenting-code-for-observability) gives a high-level overview before diving into the detailed guides.

Browse the sidebar to explore topics, or check out the [blog](/blog) for shorter-form content and insights.
