# Welcome to My Docs

This documentation section contains in-depth guides, tutorials, and reference materials on topics I work with daily. The content is organized into focused areas, each with comprehensive guides you can follow step-by-step.

## What You'll Find Here

### Observability

Complete guides to building production-grade observability systems. Start with the fundamentals, then dive into each pillar in detail, followed by language-specific instrumentation guides for **Go**, **Python**, **Java**, **C#/.NET**, and **Node.js**.

- [Introduction to Observability](/docs/observability/introduction) — Why observability matters
- [The Three Pillars](/docs/observability/three-pillars) — Logs, metrics, and traces explained
- [Logging](/docs/observability/logging) — Structured logging best practices
- [Metrics](/docs/observability/metrics) — Collection, aggregation, and visualization
- [Tracing](/docs/observability/tracing) — Distributed tracing implementation
- [Alerting](/docs/observability/alerting) — Effective alerting strategies
- [Understanding OpenTelemetry](/docs/observability/opentelemetry) — The vendor-neutral standard
- [Language Integrations](/docs/observability/integrations/overview) — Step-by-step instrumentation guides

### Best Practices

Guidelines for code quality, testing, and documentation.

- [Code Review](/docs/best-practices/code-review) — Review guidelines and checklists
- [Testing Strategies](/docs/best-practices/testing-strategies) — Unit, integration, and E2E testing
- [Documentation](/docs/best-practices/documentation) — Writing effective technical docs

## Getting Started

If you're new here, I'd recommend starting with **Observability** — it's the most comprehensive section and provides practical, hands-on guidance you can apply immediately. The [instrumentation blog post](/blog/instrumenting-code-for-observability) gives a high-level overview before diving into the detailed guides.

Browse the sidebar to explore topics, or check out the [blog](/blog) for shorter-form content and insights.
