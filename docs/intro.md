# Welcome to My Docs

This documentation section contains in-depth guides, tutorials, and reference materials on topics I work with daily. The content is organized into focused areas, each with comprehensive guides you can follow step-by-step.

## What You'll Find Here

### CI/CD

A complete guide to Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery — from fundamentals to enterprise patterns. Learn pipeline design, deployment strategies, security best practices, and platform-specific implementations.

- [Introduction to CI/CD](/docs/cicd/introduction) — Why CI/CD transforms software delivery
- [Core Concepts](/docs/cicd/core-concepts) — Pipeline anatomy, triggers, stages, and jobs
- [Branching Strategies](/docs/cicd/branching-strategies) — Trunk-based development, GitFlow, and more
- [Versioning & Releases](/docs/cicd/versioning-releases) — Semantic versioning and release management
- [Testing & Quality Gates](/docs/cicd/testing-quality) — Building test suites that create confidence
- [Security & Compliance](/docs/cicd/security-compliance-secrets) — Secrets management and security scanning
- [Deployment Strategies](/docs/cicd/deployment-strategies) — Rolling, blue-green, and canary deployments
- [Kubernetes & GitOps](/docs/cicd/kubernetes-gitops) — Patterns for K8s deployments
- [Platform Examples](/docs/cicd/platform-examples) — GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins configurations
- [Enterprise CI/CD](/docs/cicd/enterprise-cicd) — Platform engineering and governance at scale

### Observability

Complete guides to building production-grade observability systems. Start with the fundamentals, then dive into each pillar in detail, followed by language-specific instrumentation guides for **Go**, **Python**, **Java**, **C#/.NET**, and **Node.js**.

- [Introduction to Observability](/docs/observability/introduction) — Why observability matters
- [The Three Pillars](/docs/observability/three-pillars) — Logs, metrics, and traces explained
- [Logging](/docs/observability/logging) — Structured logging best practices
- [Metrics](/docs/observability/metrics) — Collection, aggregation, and visualization
- [Tracing](/docs/observability/tracing) — Distributed tracing implementation
- [Alerting](/docs/observability/alerting) — Effective alerting strategies
- [Understanding OpenTelemetry](/docs/observability/opentelemetry) — The vendor-neutral standard
- [Language Integrations](/docs/observability/integrations/overview) — Step-by-step instrumentation guides

### Best Practices

Guidelines for code quality, testing, and documentation.

- [Code Review](/docs/best-practices/code-review) — Review guidelines and checklists
- [Testing Strategies](/docs/best-practices/testing-strategies) — Unit, integration, and E2E testing
- [Documentation](/docs/best-practices/documentation) — Writing effective technical docs

## Getting Started

**New to CI/CD?** Start with the [Introduction to CI/CD](/docs/cicd/introduction) — it explains the philosophy behind continuous integration and delivery, and sets up the foundation for everything else in the guide.

**Building observability systems?** The [Introduction to Observability](/docs/observability/introduction) covers why observability matters and how to approach it. The [instrumentation blog post](/blog/instrumenting-code-for-observability) gives a practical overview before diving into the detailed guides.
