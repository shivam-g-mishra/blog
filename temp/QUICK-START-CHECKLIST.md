## The 5 Non-Negotiables

1. **Links in comments, not posts** - Doubles your reach
2. **30-min engagement before posting** - Algorithm rewards active users
3. **Strong hook in first line** - Determines if people click "see more"
4. **End with a question** - Comments are the #1 ranking signal
5. **Post Tue/Wed/Thu consistently** - Consistency beats perfection

*Start Tuesday. Post the 3 AM Nightmare. Watch what happens.*
