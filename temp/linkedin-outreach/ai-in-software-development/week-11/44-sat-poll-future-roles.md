I believe developers are evolving into architects.

Coding agents handle implementation.
Humans handle design, judgment, domain expertise.

But I'm curious what you think.

In 5 years, what will be the PRIMARY role of software engineers?

Interesting spread!

The diversity of opinions shows how uncertain this is.

My take: Options 2 and 3 will merge.

"AI collaboration specialist" = "Architect who uses AI"

The role evolves, the core value remains:
Solving problems with technology.

What's your prediction?
