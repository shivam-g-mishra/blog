New engineer joins the team.

Day 1: "So... how do we use AI here?"

Here's our onboarding process:

𝗪𝗲𝗲𝗸 𝟭: 𝗢𝗯𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲

New team member watches AI-assisted development sessions.
No pressure to use tools yet.
Just observe how we:
• Structure prompts
• Review AI output
• Handle failures

𝗪𝗲𝗲𝗸 𝟮: 𝗣𝗮𝗶𝗿

They drive, experienced dev navigates.
Real tasks, guided usage.
Focus on:
• When to use AI vs. manual
• How to provide context
• What to always verify

𝗪𝗲𝗲𝗸 𝟯: 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝗼 + 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄

Independent work.
Extra scrutiny on AI-generated code.
Explicit feedback on AI usage.

𝗪𝗲𝗲𝗸 𝟰: 𝗙𝘂𝗹𝗹 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗺𝘆

Standard review process.
They're ready.

𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀:

"Here's Cursor, figure it out" → Bad AI habits
Structured onboarding → Team-wide consistency

The investment: 4 weeks
The payoff: Years of better AI usage

How does your team onboard on AI tools?

## FIRST COMMENT

The documents we share on Day 1:

1. **AI Usage Guidelines**
   - When to use AI (boilerplate, tests, docs)
   - When NOT to use AI (security-critical, complex logic first pass)
   - Review requirements

2. **Prompt Library**
   - Templates that work for us
   - Context-setting patterns
   - Common mistakes to avoid

3. **Our Standards**
   - Coding conventions
   - Testing requirements
   - What "done" looks like

These docs ARE the AI context.
New team members AND AI read the same docs.

What's in your AI onboarding kit?
