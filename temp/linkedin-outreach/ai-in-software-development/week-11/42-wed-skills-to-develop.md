"Just prompt it right and AI works perfectly."

That's not how it works.

Here's a prompt that took me 15 iterations:

𝗧𝗮𝘀𝗸: Generate API integration tests for a payment service.

𝗜𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝟭:
"Write integration tests for the payment API."
→ Too generic. Tests didn't match our patterns.

𝗜𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝟱:
Added our testing conventions.
→ Better structure. Wrong mocking approach.

𝗜𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝟭𝟬:
Added example tests from our codebase.
→ Matched patterns. Missing edge cases.

𝗜𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝟭𝟱:
Explicit list of edge cases + error scenarios.
→ Finally. Production-ready tests.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲𝗱:
• 3 example tests from our codebase
• Our mocking conventions
• Specific edge cases to cover
• Error scenarios to test
• Naming patterns to follow

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗼𝗻:

Great AI output ≠ Great first prompt.

Great AI output = Iteration + Examples + Specificity.

The 15 iterations weren't wasted time.
They were me teaching AI what I actually wanted.

Now I reuse that prompt template for every API.

What's a prompt you've refined extensively?

## FIRST COMMENT

My prompt evolution pattern:

Attempt 1-3: Too vague → wrong direction
Attempt 4-7: Add constraints → closer
Attempt 8-12: Add examples → pattern matching
Attempt 13-15: Fine-tune edge cases → done

The key insight:

EXAMPLES beat DESCRIPTIONS every time.

Don't say "follow our patterns."
SHOW 2-3 examples of those patterns.

AI learns better from examples than instructions.

What's your most refined prompt?

## ALTERNATIVE HOOKS

**Alt 1:** "The truth about 'perfect' AI prompts: They don't exist on attempt 1"

**Alt 2:** "15 iterations later, I finally got what I wanted"

**Alt 3:** "Great prompts are ITERATED, not written"

## ENGAGEMENT TIPS

- Honest about the messiness of AI work
- Relatable struggle
- Ask for their iteration stories
- Share the evolution, not just the final result
