One prompt for complex refactoring = disaster.

Three prompts = clean results.

Here's the technique:

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘁 𝟭: 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘇𝗲

"Analyze this code. Identify:
- Current patterns used
- Potential improvements
- Dependencies to consider
- Risks of changing

Don't make changes yet."

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘁 𝟮: 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝗻

"Based on your analysis, create a refactoring plan:
- Step-by-step changes
- Order of operations
- Tests to add/modify
- Rollback strategy"

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘁 𝟯: 𝗘𝘅𝗲𝗰𝘂𝘁𝗲

"Execute step 1 of the plan.
Show me the changes before moving to step 2."

𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀:

→ Analysis prevents assumptions
→ Planning catches edge cases
→ Step-by-step execution = reviewable changes
→ You stay in control

The AI becomes a collaborator, not a black box.

## FIRST COMMENT (Post within 60 seconds)

📋 The key insight:

AI is eager to make changes immediately.

But complex refactoring needs:
✓ Understanding before action
✓ Planning before execution
✓ Incremental changes you can review

The 3-prompt technique forces this discipline.

Works for:
- Large file refactoring
- Architecture changes
- Database migrations
- API redesigns

Try it on your next complex change!

**Alt 2:** "The technique that made AI refactoring actually work for me"

**Alt 3:** "Stop asking AI to refactor in one shot. Do this instead."
