## POST CONTENT (Copy everything below the line)

"Write me Golang best practices."

That's not how you prompt AI.

Here's what actually works:

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟭: 𝗕𝗲 𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰

"Document Golang best practices for:
- Error handling patterns
- Struct and interface design
- Concurrency with goroutines
- Testing with table-driven tests
- Package organization"

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟮: 𝗔𝘀𝗸 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀

"Include code examples for each pattern.
Show both DO and DON'T."

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟯: 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗲

"We're building a REST API with
high-throughput requirements.
Optimize for production use."

Result?

A 20+ page coding guideline document that became our team's bible.

Every PR reviewed against these standards.
AI-generated, human-approved.

What's your approach to AI-generated standards?

## FIRST COMMENT (Post within 60 seconds of main post)

📝 Here's the full prompt structure we used:

```
Create comprehensive Golang best practices for:

CONTEXT:
- REST API with high-throughput requirements
- Microservices architecture
- Production environment at enterprise scale

INCLUDE:
1. Error handling patterns (with examples)
2. Struct/interface design guidelines
3. Goroutine and channel patterns
4. Table-driven testing approach
5. Package organization
6. Logging and observability
7. Configuration management

FORMAT:
- DO and DON'T examples for each
- Code snippets that can be copied
- Rationale for each recommendation
```

Comment "PROMPT" for variations in other languages (Python, Java, TypeScript)!

## ALTERNATIVE HOOKS (if original doesn't perform)

**Alt 1:** "How to get AI to write actually useful coding standards."

**Alt 2:** "The prompt structure that created our 20-page coding guidelines."

**Alt 3:** "Stop asking AI for 'best practices.' Do this instead."

---

## ENGAGEMENT TIPS

- This is highly practical content—developers will try it immediately
- Track "PROMPT" comments for language variations
- Ask follow-ups like:
  - "What language are you working in?"
  - "What standards do you wish your team had?"
- Offer to share language-specific variations

---

## EXPECTED QUESTIONS (Prepare answers)

**Q: Do you use this for other languages?**
A: "Same structure works for Python, Java, TypeScript—just adjust the specific patterns. Happy to share variants!"

**Q: How do you keep standards updated?**
A: "We treat the standards doc like code—version controlled, reviewed quarterly, updated when we learn something new."

**Q: What if AI gives wrong recommendations?**
A: "Always review! AI gives you a solid first draft. Your expertise validates and customizes it for your context."

**Q: How long did this take?**
A: "About 2-3 hours to generate and review. Would have taken days to write from scratch."
