### Slide 1 (Cover)
```
5 PROMPTS THAT
10X'D MY PRODUCTIVITY

The exact prompts I use daily
with Cursor at NVIDIA

```

### Slide 2 (The Context Setter)
```
PROMPT #1:
THE CONTEXT SETTER

"You are helping me build [project type].

Tech stack: [languages, frameworks]
Architecture: [brief description]
Standards: [link to docs or key rules]

Current task: [specific task]"

Why it works:
AI performs better with context.
Set it once, reference it always.
```

### Slide 3 (The Refactoring Prompt)
```
PROMPT #2:
THE REFACTORING PROMPT

"Refactor this code to:
1. [Specific improvement]
2. [Another improvement]
3. [Third improvement]

Constraints:
- Maintain existing behavior
- Keep function signatures
- Add tests for changes"

Why it works:
Specific goals = specific results.
Constraints prevent over-engineering.
```

### Slide 4 (The Test Generation Prompt)
```
PROMPT #3:
THE TEST GENERATOR

"Generate tests for [function/module]:

Include:
- Happy path cases
- Edge cases: [list specific ones]
- Error cases: [list expected errors]

Follow our testing pattern:
[table-driven/BDD/your pattern]"

Why it works:
Tests are only as good as your spec.
Tell AI exactly what to test.
```

### Slide 5 (The Code Review Prompt)
```
PROMPT #4:
THE CODE REVIEW PROMPT

"Review this code for:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Error handling gaps
- Naming/readability
- Test coverage gaps

For each issue:
- Severity (high/medium/low)
- Specific location
- Suggested fix"

Why it works:
Structured output = actionable feedback.
```

### Slide 6 (The Debugging Prompt)
```
PROMPT #5:
THE DEBUGGING PROMPT

"I'm seeing this error: [paste error]

Context:
- What I expected: [expected behavior]
- What happened: [actual behavior]
- Recent changes: [what changed]

Help me:
1. Identify root cause
2. Suggest fix
3. Explain why it happened"

Why it works:
Context + structure = faster solutions.
```

### Slide 7 (Bonus)
```
BONUS: THE ARCHITECTURE PROMPT

"I need to design [feature/system].

Requirements:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]

Constraints:
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]

Propose 2-3 approaches with trade-offs."

Why it works:
Options > single answer.
Trade-offs = informed decisions.
```
