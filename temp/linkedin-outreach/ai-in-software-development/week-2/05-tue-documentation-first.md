We spent 2 weeks on documentation before writing a single line of code.

With AI tools.

That sounds backwards, right?

Here's why it was the smartest decision we made:

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗲 𝗱𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗳𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁:
• Architecture design
• API specifications
• Golang coding guidelines
• Testing standards (85%+ coverage target)
• Documentation conventions
• CI/CD workflow (GitFlow)
• Code structure expectations

𝗧𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘄𝗲 𝗳𝗲𝗱 𝗶𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗿.

And asked it to bootstrap the project.

The result?

Every file followed our conventions.
Every function had proper documentation.
Every test met our coverage standards.

AI doesn't read your mind. But it reads your documents.

The 2 weeks of upfront documentation saved us months of cleanup later.

What standards do you set before letting AI write code?

## FIRST COMMENT (Post within 60 seconds of main post)

📋 Here's what we included in our standards document:

**Coding Conventions:**
• Naming patterns (functions, variables, files)
• Error handling approach
• Logging format
• Comment style

**Testing Requirements:**
• Minimum coverage (85%)
• Test file naming
• Table-driven test pattern
• Mock conventions

**Documentation:**
• README structure
• Function documentation format
• API documentation style

Comment "STANDARDS" if you want our template!

## ENGAGEMENT TIPS

- This is counterintuitive content—lean into the surprise
- Ask follow-ups like:
  - "Do you document before or after using AI?"
  - "What standards would you add to this list?"
- Emphasize the time savings in replies
- Connect to Week 1 flagship post if people ask for context

## EXPECTED QUESTIONS (Prepare answers)

**Q: Isn't 2 weeks a lot for documentation?**
A: "It sounds like a lot, but AI helped create the docs too. And it saved us months of refactoring later. Net positive."

**Q: What if requirements change?**
A: "Documents evolve. We updated them as we learned. The point is having a baseline for AI to follow."

**Q: Can't AI just figure out the standards?**
A: "It can guess, but guesses are inconsistent. Your explicit standards = consistent output across the entire codebase."

**Q: How detailed do standards need to be?**
A: "Enough that a new team member (or AI) could follow them without asking questions. Usually 5-10 pages total."
