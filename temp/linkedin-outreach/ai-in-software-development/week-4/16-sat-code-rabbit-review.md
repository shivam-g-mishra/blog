"AI code review will replace human reviewers."

I've used Code Rabbit for 6+ months.

Here's the truth:

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗥𝗮𝗯𝗯𝗶𝘁 𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵𝗲𝘀:
✓ Security vulnerabilities
✓ Performance issues
✓ Code style inconsistencies
✓ Missing error handling
✓ Obvious bugs
✓ Documentation gaps

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗥𝗮𝗯𝗯𝗶𝘁 𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀:
✗ Business logic correctness
✗ Architectural fit
✗ Domain-specific issues
✗ Team conventions (unless configured)
✗ "Is this the right approach?"

𝗠𝘆 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗳𝗹𝗼𝘄:

1. Code Rabbit reviews every PR (automated)
2. I address its feedback first
3. Human reviewer focuses on bigger picture
4. Final approval from human

AI handles the tedious checks.
Humans handle the judgment calls.

It's not replacement. It's augmentation.

PRs that took 30 min to review now take 10.

How are you using AI for code review?

## FIRST COMMENT

The biggest value of AI code review:

It's CONSISTENT.

Human reviewers:
• Have good days and bad days
• Miss things when tired
• Have varying standards

AI reviewers:
• Same thoroughness every time
• Never get tired
• Apply rules consistently

The combination > either alone.

What's your review workflow?
