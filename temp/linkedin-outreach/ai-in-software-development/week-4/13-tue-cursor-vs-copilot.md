Cursor vs. GitHub Copilot

After 6 months using both daily, here's my honest take:

𝗚𝗶𝘁𝗛𝘂𝗯 𝗖𝗼𝗽𝗶𝗹𝗼𝘁:
✓ Best inline completions
✓ Feels native in VS Code
✓ Great for small suggestions
✓ Lower learning curve

✗ Limited for complex tasks
✗ Less control over context
✗ Chat is okay, not great

𝗖𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗿:
✓ Agent mode for complex tasks
✓ Better context management
✓ Composer for multi-file changes
✓ Rules for consistency

✗ Steeper learning curve
✗ Can be overwhelming
✗ Sometimes over-engineers

𝗠𝘆 𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗱𝗶𝗰𝘁:

Use Copilot for: Quick completions, small changes, familiar code

Use Cursor for: Complex features, refactoring, new projects

They're not competitors. They're different tools for different jobs.

I actually use both.

What's your experience?

## FIRST COMMENT

The real question isn't "which is better?"

It's "what are you trying to do?"

Quick autocomplete → Copilot wins
Build entire features → Cursor wins
Learning new codebase → Both help differently

I've settled on Cursor as my primary (agent mode is powerful) but I miss Copilot's inline suggestions sometimes.

What's your setup?
