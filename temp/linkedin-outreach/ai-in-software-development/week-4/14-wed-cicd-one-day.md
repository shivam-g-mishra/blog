1 day.

That's how long it took to build our entire CI/CD pipeline.

Not the application. The PIPELINE.

Traditional timeline? 1-2 weeks minimum.

Here's what we shipped in a single day using Cursor:

✓ GitLab CI/CD configuration
✓ Build automation
✓ Test execution
✓ Code coverage reporting
✓ Semantic versioning
✓ Release automation
✓ GitFlow branching workflow

Modern GitOps. Fully automated. Production-ready.

The secret?

I didn't write the pipeline from scratch.

I described what I wanted:
"GitOps-based CI/CD for a Golang service.
GitFlow branching. Semantic versioning.
85%+ coverage gate. Automated releases."

Cursor understood the patterns.
It knew the GitLab CI syntax.
It connected the pieces.

I reviewed, refined, and shipped.

What used to take me a week of YAML wrestling?
Done before lunch.

What's your CI/CD setup story?

## FIRST COMMENT

📋 The exact prompt I used:

"Create a GitLab CI/CD pipeline for:

Project: Golang REST API
Requirements:
- GitFlow branching (main, develop, feature/*, release/*)
- Semantic versioning with automatic tagging
- Test execution with 85% coverage gate
- Build artifacts for releases
- Automated changelog generation

Use latest GitLab CI best practices."

Key insight: The more specific your requirements, the better the output.

I iterated 3 times:
1. First version: Good structure, wrong caching
2. Second version: Fixed caching, missing artifacts
3. Third version: Production-ready

Total time: ~4 hours including testing

What's your biggest CI/CD pain point?

**Alt 1:** "I built our entire CI/CD pipeline before lunch. Here's how."

**Alt 2:** "No more YAML wrestling. AI did it in hours."

**Alt 3:** "From zero to production CI/CD in one day."
