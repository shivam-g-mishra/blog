People keep asking about my Cursor setup.

Here's the rule file I use for our NVIDIA projects:

𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗿𝘂𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿:

Without rules:
- AI makes assumptions
- Style is inconsistent
- You repeat the same instructions

With rules:
- AI follows YOUR conventions
- Every output matches your standards
- Zero repeated context-setting

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲:

✓ Coding conventions
✓ File structure expectations
✓ Testing requirements
✓ Documentation format
✓ Error handling patterns
✓ Naming conventions

Think of rules as your "AI onboarding document."

Train Cursor once. Benefit forever.

Drop your Cursor rules in the comments—let's share what works.
