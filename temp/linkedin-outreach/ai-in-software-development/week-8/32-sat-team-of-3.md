8 weeks ago, I shared our NVIDIA AI development story.

Since then, 500+ developers have shared their experiences with me.

Here's what I've learned from YOU:

𝗧𝗵𝗲 #𝟭 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗲 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗳𝗮𝗰𝗲𝘀:
Context management. AI loses track of large codebases.
(Progress logs help—but it's still hard)

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗼𝗽𝗶𝗰:
Whether juniors should use AI heavily.
Strong opinions both ways.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗿𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁:
Actual prompts and configs.
(Delivered in the carousel last week)

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗽𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴:
Most teams are EXPERIMENTING, not scaling.
Enterprise adoption is slower than solo devs.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗵:
Everyone agrees human judgment matters.
Nobody thinks AI should ship unchecked.

Thank you for teaching me as much as I've shared.

This community is what makes LinkedIn worth it.

What's been most valuable in these 8 weeks for YOU?

## FIRST COMMENT

The themes that resonated most:

1. Progress logs (practical)
2. Documentation-first (counterintuitive)
3. Testing MORE not less (surprising)
4. Human judgment (reassuring)

The themes that sparked debate:

1. Vibe coding
2. Junior developer usage
3. Future of developer roles

I learn as much from your comments as you do from my posts.

What topic should I go deeper on?
