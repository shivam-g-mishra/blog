AI isn't going away.
Neither am I.

## FIRST COMMENT

The honest truth:

Month 1: "This is overhyped"
Month 6: "Okay, this is useful"
Month 12: "I can't imagine working without it"
Month 18: "How did we ever do this before?"

The learning curve is real.
The payoff is also real.

Where are you on the journey?
