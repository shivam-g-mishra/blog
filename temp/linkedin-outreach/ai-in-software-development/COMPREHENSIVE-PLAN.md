## Differentiation from Observability Campaign

| Aspect | Observability Campaign | AI Development Campaign |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Tone** | Technical authority | Exploratory, collaborative |
| **Goal** | Drive to blog/documentation | Build community, learn together |
| **Content** | Educational, definitive | Discussion-oriented, evolving |
| **Audience** | SREs, DevOps, Backend | All developers, especially full-stack |
| **CTA Style** | "Here's the guide" | "What's your experience?" |
| **Authority** | "I've done this at scale" | "I'm figuring this out too" |

---

## Key Messages to Reinforce

1. **AI is a multiplier, not a replacement** - Your expertise determines how much value you get from AI

2. **The learning curve is real** - It takes time to use these tools effectively

3. **Human judgment is still critical** - AI makes suggestions, you make decisions

4. **Adapt or be left behind** - But adaptation isn't about fear, it's about opportunity

5. **We're all learning together** - Nobody has this fully figured out

---

## Content Tone Guidelines

### DO:
- Share genuine experiences (wins AND failures)
- Acknowledge uncertainty ("I'm still figuring this out")
- Ask questions and invite discussion
- Be specific (tool names, specific prompts, real scenarios)
- Show before/after comparisons
- Admit when AI doesn't work well

### DON'T:
- Hype AI as a silver bullet
- Dismiss AI skeptics
- Claim to have all the answers
- Be preachy or condescending
- Only share successes (be balanced)
- Make content too theoretical (keep it practical)

---
