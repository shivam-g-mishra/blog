I'm researching how teams are using AI at scale.

Building with AI as a solo dev is different from enterprise.

At NVIDIA, we learned:
• Token limits crash agents
• Review becomes the bottleneck
• Progress logs are essential
• Multi-model strategy matters

But I'm curious about YOUR experience.

How is your team using AI in development?
