AIOPS
HYPE vs. REALITY

An honest assessment from
years in observability

[Swipe →]
```

### Slide 2 (The Hype)
```
THE HYPE:

• "AI will automatically fix all issues"
• "No more on-call"
• "Set it and forget it"
• "Magic anomaly detection"
• "Zero false positives"

Sound familiar?
```

### Slide 3 (The Reality)
```
THE REALITY:

• AI ASSISTS with root cause analysis
• On-call still needed (for now)
• Requires tuning and oversight
• Anomaly detection works, needs context
• False positives still exist

Not magic. Just powerful tools.
```

### Slide 4 (What Works)
```
WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS:

✓ AI correlating multiple signals
✓ AI summarizing incident context
✓ AI suggesting similar past incidents
✓ Natural language queries
✓ Intelligent alert grouping
✓ Faster triage
```

### Slide 5 (What Doesn't)
```
WHAT DOESN'T WORK (YET):

✗ Fully autonomous resolution
✗ "Set and forget" detection
✗ Replacing human judgment
✗ Understanding business context
✗ Novel failure modes
```

### Slide 6 (Real Value)
```
THE REAL VALUE:

Before AIOps:
• 60 min avg. to root cause
• 50+ alerts per incident
• Manual correlation

After AIOps:
• 15 min avg. to root cause
• 5 actionable alerts
• Auto-correlated signals

Not magic. Measurable improvement.
```

### Slide 7 (Advice)
```
MY ADVICE:

1. Start small (one use case)
2. Measure before/after
3. Don't over-promise
4. Keep humans in the loop
5. Iterate based on results

Skeptical optimism > blind faith
```

### Slide 8 (CTA)
```
AIOps is real and valuable.

But it's augmentation,
not automation.

Human + AI > Either alone

What's your AIOps experience?
```

## FIRST COMMENT

The balanced take:

AIOps vendors: "AI solves everything!"
AIOps skeptics: "It's all hype!"

Reality: Somewhere in between.

AI makes operations BETTER.
AI doesn't make operations AUTOMATIC.

The teams winning with AIOps:
• Set realistic expectations
• Measure improvements
• Keep humans in the loop
• Iterate continuously

What's working for you?
