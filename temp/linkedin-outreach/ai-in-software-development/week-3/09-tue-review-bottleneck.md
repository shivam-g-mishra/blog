The hardest part of AI-assisted development?

Not the coding.
Not the debugging.
Not the architecture.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄𝘀.

When we built our NVIDIA service with Cursor, AI generated:
• 50+ pages of design documentation
• 100+ API endpoints documented
• Detailed implementation plans for every feature
• Test cases, edge cases, error handling

Our team couldn't keep up.

We went from "not enough documentation" to "drowning in documentation."

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘄 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝘁𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗰𝗸:

Before AI: Development speed
After AI: Review capacity

This is the conversation nobody's having about AI development.

Yes, AI makes you faster.
But your team's review bandwidth doesn't scale with it.

How is your team handling the review volume?

## FIRST COMMENT (Post within 60 seconds)

Our solutions:

1. **Prioritize ruthlessly** - Not everything needs deep review
2. **AI-assisted review** - Use Code Rabbit for first pass
3. **Incremental commits** - Smaller PRs = faster reviews
4. **Documentation tiers** - Critical docs get full review, others get skim

The irony: We needed AI to help review AI-generated content.

What's your review strategy?

**Alt 2:** "The AI development problem nobody warned me about."

**Alt 3:** "AI made us faster. Then reviews became the bottleneck."
