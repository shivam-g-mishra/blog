### Slide 1 (Cover)
```
AI IN DEVELOPMENT
HYPE vs. REALITY

An honest assessment after
18 months at NVIDIA

[Swipe →]
```

### Slide 2
```
HYPE: "AI writes perfect code"

REALITY: AI writes decent first drafts

You still need to:
• Review everything
• Catch edge cases
• Fix subtle bugs
• Ensure security
```

### Slide 3
```
HYPE: "Developers will be replaced"

REALITY: Different skills matter

More valuable now:
• Architecture
• System design
• Business knowledge
• Quality judgment

Less valuable:
• Boilerplate writing
• Syntax memorization
```

### Slide 4
```
HYPE: "10x productivity instantly"

REALITY: 2-3x after learning curve

The curve includes:
• Prompt engineering
• Tool configuration
• Workflow adaptation
• When to use vs. not use AI
```

### Slide 5
```
HYPE: "No more debugging"

REALITY: Different kinds of bugs

New bugs to watch for:
• AI hallucinations
• Context misunderstandings
• Subtle logic errors
• Security oversights
```

### Slide 6
```
WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS:

✓ Boilerplate generation
✓ Test writing
✓ Documentation
✓ Refactoring
✓ Code review assistance
✓ Research & learning
```

### Slide 7
```
WHAT STILL DOESN'T WORK:

✗ Complex business logic (first try)
✗ Understanding legacy codebases
✗ Making architectural decisions
✗ Knowing your specific context
✗ Replacing human judgment
```

### Slide 8 (CTA)
```
The truth:

AI is a powerful tool.
Not a magic solution.

Use it wisely.
Stay skeptical.
Keep learning.

What's your AI reality check?
```

## FIRST COMMENT

My biggest reality check:

AI accelerates what you're already good at.

If you're a great engineer → AI makes you faster.
If you're still learning → AI can mislead you.

The tool amplifies the user.

What surprised you most about AI dev tools?
