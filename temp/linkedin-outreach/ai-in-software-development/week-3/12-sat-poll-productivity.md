Everyone claims AI makes them "10x more productive."

But I want real data.

After using AI coding tools (Cursor, Copilot, etc.), how has your actual productivity changed?

Be honest—I'm collecting this for a future analysis.

Interesting distribution!

For those who said "significantly faster":
→ What tasks got the biggest boost?

For those who said "about the same" or "slower":
→ What's the main blocker?

This data helps me create better content for what actually works.
