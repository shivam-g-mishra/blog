I "vibe coded" a production service at NVIDIA.

There, I said it.

Here's what that actually looked like:

✓ Design documents created with AI assistance
✓ Architecture defined collaboratively with AI
✓ Coding standards generated by AI (then reviewed)
✓ Features implemented by AI (with human oversight)

Call it what you want.

But here's what it ALSO was:

✓ 85%+ test coverage
✓ Enterprise-grade CI/CD
✓ Production-ready
✓ Following industry best practices
✓ Properly documented
✓ Maintainable by the team

"Vibe coding" criticism assumes recklessness.

But using AI aggressively ≠ abandoning standards.

The "vibe" isn't "whatever compiles."
The "vibe" is "human judgment + AI capability."

You can embrace AI AND maintain rigor.
These aren't opposites.

What's your definition of vibe coding?

## FIRST COMMENT (Post within 60 seconds)

Hot take: "Vibe coding" criticism often comes from two camps:

1. People who haven't tried AI tools seriously
2. People who used AI without standards/testing

The middle ground exists:
→ Use AI aggressively
→ Maintain high quality bars
→ Review everything
→ Test rigorously

That's not reckless. That's efficient.

Agree or disagree?

**Alt 2:** "200K lines. 3,248 tests. 1 year. Call it what you want."

**Alt 3:** "The term is 'vibe coding.' The result was production-ready."
