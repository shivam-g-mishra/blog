# FINAL REVIEW: Critical Issues & Required Fixes

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Campaign Has Serious Repetition Problems

After thorough review, I found **3 major themes repeated excessively** that will cause audience fatigue and reduce impact. This needs to be fixed before launch.

---

## ISSUE #1: "Documentation First" Said 5+ Times

| Post | Where |
|------|-------|
| #1 | First comment: "Documentation FIRST, code SECOND" |
| #5 | **Entire post about documentation-first** |
| #21 | **Entire post about documentation as AI context** (near duplicate) |
| #45 | Lesson #1 AND Lesson #9 both about documentation |
| #48 | Lesson #2 mentions documentation |

**PROBLEM:** By Week 6, audience will think "We've heard this already."

**FIX REQUIRED:**
- Post #5: KEEP (first mention)
- Post #21: CHANGE to different topic
- Post #45: Reduce to ONE documentation mention

---

## ISSUE #2: "Future of Developers/Skills" Said 10+ Times

| Post | Topic |
|------|-------|
| #23 | Carousel: Skills that matter in AI era |
| #33 | Developers becoming architects |
| #34 | Tools not replacements |
| #35 | Carousel: Developer evolution |
| #36 | Business knowledge matters |
| #41 | Architect-coder hybrid |
| #42 | Skills to develop NOW |
| #43 | Learning roadmap (fixed, but still skills) |
| #48 | More about skills |

**PROBLEM:** 10 posts about essentially the same message: "AI changes developer roles, learn system design." This is overkill.

**FIX REQUIRED:**
- Keep: #33, #36, #43 (consolidated)
- Change: #34, #41, #42 to different topics
- Merge/reduce carousel overlap

---

## ISSUE #3: Flagship Stats Repeated Too Often

| Post | Stats Mentioned |
|------|-----------------|
| #1 | Full stats (200K, 3,248, 3, 2) ✓ OK |
| #34 | "I just shipped 200,000 lines..." ✗ |
| #41 | "Our team of 3 shipped 200K lines..." ✗ |
| #45 | "3,248 tests. 2:1 ratio..." ✗ |

**FIX REQUIRED:** Remove stat mentions from #34, #41, #45

---

## ISSUE #4: Weak Hashtag Strategy

### Current Problems:
- `#AI` is too generic (millions of posts)
- `#Engineering` is too broad
- No consistent community-building hashtags
- Missing branded/discoverable hashtags

### RECOMMENDED HASHTAG STRATEGY:

**Tier 1 - Always Use (pick 2):**
- `#AIDevelopment` (niche, growing)
- `#AIcoding` (specific)
- `#DevTools` (tool-focused)

**Tier 2 - Rotate (pick 1-2):**
- `#CursorAI` (tool community)
- `#AgenticAI` (trending)
- `#DeveloperProductivity`
- `#TechLeadership`
- `#SoftwareArchitecture`

**Tier 3 - Occasional (when relevant):**
- `#Golang` / `#Java` (language-specific)
- `#GitOps` / `#CICD` (DevOps)
- `#CodeReview` (practice-specific)

**NEVER Use (too generic):**
- `#AI` alone
- `#Engineering` alone
- `#Technology`
- `#Coding`

---

## ISSUE #5: Generic Engagement Questions

### Current Weak CTAs:
- "What's your experience?"
- "What do you think?"
- "Agree or disagree?"
- "What are you learning?"

### STRONGER ALTERNATIVES:

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "What's your experience?" | "What's ONE thing AI has failed to do well for you?" |
| "What do you think?" | "Do you think juniors should use AI heavily? Why or why not?" |
| "Agree or disagree?" | "If you could only use ONE AI tool for the next year, which would it be?" |
| "What are you learning?" | "What's the most surprising thing AI taught you about your own code?" |

---

## ISSUE #6: Consecutive Days With Same Theme

### Week 9 Problem:
- Tue: Developers becoming architects
- Wed: Tools not replacements (SAME THEME)
- Sat: Business knowledge matters (SAME THEME)

### Week 11 Problem:
- Tue: Architect-coder hybrid
- Wed: Skills to develop (SAME THEME)

**FIX:** Alternate themes within weeks

## COMPLETE LIST OF POSTS REQUIRING CHANGES

### HIGH PRIORITY (Must Fix):

| Post | Current | Change To |
|------|---------|-----------|
| #21 | Documentation as AI context | **AI debugging: The screenshot workflow that saves hours** |
| #34 | Tools not replacements | **The AI suggestion that taught me something new** |
| #41 | Architect-coder hybrid | **How I onboard new team members on AI workflows** |
| #42 | Skills to develop | **The prompt that took 15 iterations to perfect** |

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Should Fix):

| Post | Current | Fix |
|------|---------|-----|
| #34 | Repeats "200K lines" stat | Remove stat reference |
| #41 | Repeats "200K lines" stat | Remove stat reference |
| #45 | Lessons #1 and #9 both about docs | Merge into one lesson |

### LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Fix):

| Post | Issue | Fix |
|------|-------|-----|
| All posts | Generic ending questions | Replace with specific questions |
| All posts | Inconsistent hashtags | Apply hashtag strategy |
