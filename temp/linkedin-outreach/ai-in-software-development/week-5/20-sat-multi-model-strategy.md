Not all AI models are created equal.

Here's what we learned building at NVIDIA:

𝗖𝗹𝗮𝘂𝗱𝗲: Long feature implementations
More sophisticated reasoning.
Better at maintaining context across complex tasks.

𝗠𝗮𝘅 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘀 (𝟭𝗠 𝘁𝗼𝗸𝗲𝗻𝘀): Large codebase understanding
When you need to reference many files.
Architecture-level discussions.

𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘀 (𝟮𝟬𝟬𝗞 𝘁𝗼𝗸𝗲𝗻𝘀): Quick tasks
Faster responses.
Sufficient for focused changes.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺:
Token limits cause crashes.
You hit the ceiling, the agent dies.
Progress lost.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻:
Match model to task complexity.
Maintain progress logs (essential).
Start fresh sessions strategically.

Different tools for different jobs.

What's your model selection strategy?

## FIRST COMMENT

My rule of thumb:

Quick fix, single file → Fast model (GPT-4o mini, Haiku)
Feature implementation → Standard model (GPT-4o, Sonnet)
Architecture, large refactor → Max model (Claude with 1M context)

The cost difference is real.
But so is the capability difference.

Match the model to the task.

What models do you use for what?
