3,248 tests.

That's what we shipped.

For a project built "with AI."

Plot twist:

We test MORE rigorously after adopting AI.

Not less. More.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗻𝘂𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗿𝘀:
• API Server: 2,168 test methods
• Agent: 1,080 test functions
• Test-to-production ratio: 2:1
• More test code than production code

𝗕𝗲𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗔𝗜:
Writing tests was time-consuming.
Coverage targets felt like a burden.
"We'll add tests later" was common.

𝗔𝗳𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗔𝗜:
Writing tests is a click of a button.
Coverage targets are easy to exceed.
"Let's add more edge cases" is common.

The constraint changed.

When testing was expensive, we compromised.
When testing became cheap, we raised the bar.

High code coverage kept us safe—AI couldn't break existing features because tests caught everything.

"AI code is sloppy" is a myth.

AI code WITH proper testing is actually MORE reliable.

What's your test-to-production ratio?

## FIRST COMMENT

The insight:

AI makes testing CHEAP.

So we invested more in it.

Every feature now has:
• Unit tests (table-driven)
• Integration tests
• Edge case coverage
• Error path tests

AI generates the test structure.
We verify the test logic.

Result: Higher quality than before AI.

Counterintuitive? Yes.
True? Also yes.

## ALTERNATIVE HOOKS

**Alt 1:** "We have more test code than production code. Here's why."

**Alt 2:** "3,248 tests. All AI-assisted. Here's the secret."

**Alt 3:** "'AI code is sloppy.' Our test numbers say otherwise."

## ENGAGEMENT TIPS

- Challenges common narrative
- Share specific test patterns if asked
- Ask about their testing approach
