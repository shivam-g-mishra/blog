I tried ChatGPT for coding.

For 3 months.

Then I stopped.

Here's why:

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺𝘀:

1. 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝘀𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴
Copy code → Paste in browser → Copy response → Paste back.
Friction kills flow.

2. 𝗡𝗼 𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗮𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀
ChatGPT doesn't know my project structure.
Cursor reads my entire repo.

3. 𝗢𝘂𝘁𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲
I got suggestions for deprecated APIs.
IDE-integrated tools stay current.

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜 𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗱:

For coding: Cursor (codebase-aware)
For complex reasoning: Claude (better thinking)
For research: Perplexity (citations)

ChatGPT is great for many things.

Just not for MY coding workflow.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗼𝗻:

The best AI tool is the one that fits YOUR workflow.

Not the most popular.
Not the newest.
The one with least friction.

What AI tool did you stop using?

## FIRST COMMENT

To be clear:

I still use ChatGPT for:
• Explaining concepts
• Brainstorming
• Writing/editing
• General questions

Just not for coding.

The friction of copy-paste was killing my productivity.

Cursor being IN my editor changed everything.

What tools have you abandoned? And why?
