SKILLS THAT MATTER MORE
IN THE AI ERA

What to learn when AI
handles the coding

[Swipe →]
```

### Slide 2
```
SKILL #1:
SYSTEM DESIGN

• How components connect
• Trade-off analysis
• Scaling patterns
• Architecture decisions

AI can implement.
YOU need to design.
```

### Slide 3
```
SKILL #2:
DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE

• Your industry's specifics
• User problems
• Business context
• What "success" means

AI doesn't know your business.
You do.
```

### Slide 4
```
SKILL #3:
PROBLEM FRAMING

• Turning vague → specific
• Asking right questions
• Defining constraints
• Scoping work

AI needs clear inputs.
You provide them.
```

### Slide 5
```
SKILL #4:
QUALITY JUDGMENT

• When code is "good enough"
• Spotting subtle bugs
• Maintaining standards
• Knowing what to test

AI generates.
You validate.
```

### Slide 6
```
SKILL #5:
AI COLLABORATION

• Effective prompting
• Context management
• Tool selection
• When NOT to use AI

Using AI well is a skill.
It takes practice.
```

### Slide 7
```
SKILLS THAT MATTER LESS:

• Syntax memorization
• Boilerplate writing
• Basic debugging
• Documentation formatting
• Routine coding

AI handles these now.
```

### Slide 8 (CTA)
```
THE FUTURE DEVELOPER:

System thinker +
Domain expert +
AI collaborator

Not "coder who uses AI"
But "architect who leverages AI"

What skills are you building?
```

## FIRST COMMENT

The pattern I'm seeing:

Skills that are AMPLIFIED by AI:
→ Architecture thinking
→ Business understanding
→ Quality judgment

Skills that are REPLACED by AI:
→ Boilerplate writing
→ Syntax knowledge
→ Routine debugging

Invest in the first category.

What skill are you focusing on?
