6 months ago, I built a production service with AI.

Today, I'd do it twice as fast.

Not because the tools got better.
Because I got better at using them.

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲𝗱:

1. 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻
Then: Vague descriptions
Now: Exact details about what, why, and constraints

2. 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝗰𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲
Then: Jump to implementation
Now: Review the plan THOROUGHLY before coding

3. 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘀𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴
Then: Hope AI figures it out
Now: Tell AI exactly what success looks like

4. 𝗜𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝘆
Then: One big prompt, hope for the best
Now: Small steps, verify each, build on success

The biggest lesson?

Planning before implementation makes a HUGE difference in final code quality.

AI amplifies your clarity.
Unclear input → unclear output.
Precise input → precise output.

What's your biggest AI prompting lesson?

## FIRST COMMENT

The meta-skill:

Learning to use AI tools is itself a skill.

It took me ~3 months to be "good" at prompting.
Another 3 months to be "great" at it.

The investment pays off exponentially.

Don't expect instant productivity gains.
Expect a learning curve.
Then expect compounding returns.

How long did it take you to get comfortable?
