without chaos

[Swipe →]
```

### Slide 2
```
PHASE 1: PILOT (2 weeks)

• Select 2-3 volunteers
• Single project focus
• Document everything
• Weekly check-ins

Goal: Learn what works
before scaling.
```

### Slide 3
```
PHASE 2: STANDARDS (1 week)

Create team guidelines:
• When to use AI
• When NOT to use AI
• Review requirements
• Testing expectations

No standards = chaos.
```

### Slide 4
```
PHASE 3: TRAINING (ongoing)

• Share prompts that work
• Document common pitfalls
• Pair programming sessions
• Internal demos

Learning curve is real.
Accelerate it.
```

### Slide 5
```
PHASE 4: SCALE (gradual)

• Add 2-3 people per week
• Refine standards as needed
• Address concerns early
• Celebrate wins

Don't rush. Build confidence.
```

### Slide 6
```
COMMON MISTAKES:

✗ Mandating AI use
✗ No review process
✗ Ignoring skeptics
✗ No standards/guidelines
✗ Expecting instant results

Avoid these.
```

### Slide 7
```
SUCCESS METRICS:

✓ Code quality maintained
✓ Developer satisfaction
✓ Velocity improvement
✓ Review coverage
✓ Test coverage

Measure what matters.
```

### Slide 8 (CTA)
```
The key:

Go slow to go fast.

Pilot → Standards → Training → Scale

Rushing adoption = problems.
Patient rollout = success.

How did your team adopt AI tools?
```

## FIRST COMMENT

The biggest lesson:

Don't mandate AI use.

Some devs will love it.
Some will resist.
Both are okay.

Let results speak.
When productivity gains are visible, adoption follows naturally.

Force it = resistance.
Demonstrate it = adoption.

What's your team's approach?

## ENGAGEMENT TIPS

- Leadership/manager audience
- Ask about their rollout experience
- Share specific challenges and solutions
