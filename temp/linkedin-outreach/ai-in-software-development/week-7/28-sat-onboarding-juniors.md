"Should junior developers use AI tools?"

Hot take: Yes, but differently.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗸:
Juniors using AI without understanding fundamentals.
Copy-paste without learning.
"It works" without knowing why.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗼𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘁𝘆:
AI as a learning accelerator.
Explanations on demand.
Seeing patterns across examples.

𝗢𝘂𝗿 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵:

1. Fundamentals first (no AI for first 2 weeks)
2. AI as explainer ("Why does this work?")
3. AI generates, junior explains
4. Code review focuses on understanding
5. Gradually increase AI autonomy

The key question in reviews:
"Can you explain what this code does?"

If they can't explain it, they rewrite it manually.

AI should accelerate learning, not replace it.

How do you onboard juniors with AI tools?

## FIRST COMMENT

The best use of AI for juniors:

"Explain this code like I'm a beginner."
"Why did you choose this approach?"
"What are the alternatives?"
"What could go wrong here?"

AI as a patient teacher.
Available 24/7.
Never frustrated by questions.

But still needs human mentorship for:
• Career guidance
• Code review
• Context they can't google
• Judgment calls

What's your take?
