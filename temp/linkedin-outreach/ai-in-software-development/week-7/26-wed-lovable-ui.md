I spent 4 hours on one feature.

AI couldn't get it right.

Not Cursor. Not Claude. Not GPT-4.

Nothing worked.

The task: A custom workflow engine with conditional branching, parallel execution, and rollback capabilities.

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗱:

Attempt 1: AI generated something that looked right but had race conditions.

Attempt 2: Fixed races, broke rollback logic.

Attempt 3: AI started over, ignored my corrections.

Attempt 4: Massive over-engineering. 500 lines for what needed 100.

Attempt 5: I gave up and wrote it myself.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗼𝗻:

AI struggles when:
→ Requirements span multiple complex patterns
→ State management is intricate
→ You can't show a clear example
→ The "right answer" requires deep domain context

Some code just needs a human brain.

And that's okay.

Knowing when NOT to use AI is as important as knowing when to use it.

What feature has AI failed to build for you?

## FIRST COMMENT

What I've learned about AI limitations:

𝗔𝗜 𝗲𝘅𝗰𝗲𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝘁:
• Clear, well-defined tasks
• Common patterns with examples
• Boilerplate with specifications
• Refactoring existing code

𝗔𝗜 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗴𝗴𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵:
• Novel architectures
• Complex state management
• Multi-system coordination
• Problems you can't clearly specify

The skill: Recognizing which type you're facing BEFORE you waste 4 hours.

What patterns have you noticed?

## ENGAGEMENT TIPS

- Failure stories build trust
- Ask about their struggles
- Be honest about limitations
- This balances the success stories
