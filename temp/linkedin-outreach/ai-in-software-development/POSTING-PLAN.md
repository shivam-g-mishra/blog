```
📚 Here's the breakdown of our 5-phase workflow:

1. Design (1 week): AI brainstorming + docs
2. Standards (1 week): Coding guidelines, testing rules
3. Bootstrap (1 day): Project structure from standards
4. Roadmap (3 days): Milestones + actionable items
5. Build (6-7 weeks): Feature-by-feature implementation

Key insight: Documentation FIRST, code SECOND.

AI follows your standards—if you give it standards to follow.

## Differentiation from Observability Campaign

| Aspect | Observability | AI Development |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Tone** | Expert teaching | Practitioner exploring |
| **Goal** | Drive to blog | Build community |
| **CTAs** | "Here's the guide" | "What's your experience?" |
| **Authority** | "I've done this at scale" | "I'm figuring this out too" |
| **Audience** | SREs, DevOps | All developers |

## Recovery Tactics (If Posts Flop)

### If engagement is low:
1. Don't delete (looks bad)
2. Engage heavily with others' content
3. Wait 24 hours before next post
4. Try same topic with different hook

### Safe recovery posts:
- Poll (always gets engagement)
- Story post (relatable)
- Hot take (drives comments)

---

## Content Tone Guidelines

### DO:
- Share genuine experiences (wins AND failures)
- Acknowledge uncertainty
- Ask questions and invite discussion
- Be specific (tool names, real numbers)
- Admit when AI doesn't work

### DON'T:
- Hype AI as silver bullet
- Dismiss AI skeptics
- Claim to have all answers
- Be preachy or condescending
- Only share successes
