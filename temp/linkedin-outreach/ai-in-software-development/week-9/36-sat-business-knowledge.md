Counterintuitive career advice for developers:

Learn LESS about syntax.
Learn MORE about business.

Here's why:

𝗔𝗜 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗱𝗼:
✓ Write code
✓ Debug code
✓ Generate tests
✓ Refactor modules
✓ Create documentation

𝗔𝗜 𝗰𝗮𝗻'𝘁 𝗱𝗼:
✗ Understand your business context
✗ Know your users' real problems
✗ Make strategic trade-offs
✗ Navigate organizational dynamics
✗ Define what "success" means

The gap between "code that works" and "code that matters" is DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE.

When I built our NVIDIA service with AI:

The hard part wasn't coding.
The hard part was knowing WHAT to build.
Understanding WHY certain trade-offs mattered.
Connecting technical decisions to business outcomes.

AI amplified our velocity.
Domain expertise determined our direction.

The developers who thrive in 5 years:
→ Deep understanding of their industry
→ Strong problem-framing skills
→ Business/technical translation ability
→ System design expertise

The developers who struggle:
→ "I only know how to code"

Invest in understanding your domain.

It's becoming your moat.

What domain knowledge are you developing?

## FIRST COMMENT

The formula:

Technical skills × Domain knowledge = Career ceiling

Before AI:
Great code = competitive advantage

After AI:
Great code is table stakes.
Understanding the problem = competitive advantage.

The developer who understands the business will always beat the one who only understands the code.

What's your domain?
