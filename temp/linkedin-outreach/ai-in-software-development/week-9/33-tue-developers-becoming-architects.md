The future of software engineering:

Developers become architects.
Coding becomes implementation detail.

Here's what I mean:

𝗧𝗼𝗱𝗮𝘆'𝘀 𝗱𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿:
- Writes code
- Debugs code
- Reviews code
- Maintains code

𝗧𝗼𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗿𝗼𝘄'𝘀 𝗱𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿:
- Designs systems end-to-end
- Defines architecture and constraints
- Makes business/technical trade-offs
- Validates AI-generated implementations
- Maintains domain expertise

The coding agent handles the implementation.
YOU handle the thinking.

This isn't job loss.
This is job elevation.

The skills that matter:
→ System design
→ Business/domain knowledge
→ Architecture patterns
→ Quality judgment
→ Problem framing

The skills that matter less:
→ Syntax memorization
→ Boilerplate generation
→ Routine debugging

Software engineers are being promoted to architects.

Whether you like it or not.

Are you preparing for this shift?

## FIRST COMMENT

The parallel:

Architects don't lay bricks.
But they understand construction deeply.

Future developers won't write every line.
But they'll understand code deeply.

The role elevates from "builder" to "designer."

Same domain. Higher abstraction.

Agree or disagree?

## ALTERNATIVE HOOKS

**Alt 1:** "Software engineers are being promoted. To architects."

**Alt 2:** "The coding will be automated. The thinking won't."

**Alt 3:** "Why tomorrow's developer looks more like today's architect"
