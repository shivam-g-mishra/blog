What I wish I knew before diving into AI coding tools:

𝟭. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹
Month 1: "This is overhyped"
Month 3: "Okay, getting useful"
Month 6: "Can't imagine working without it"

Be patient. It compounds.

𝟮. 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗳𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 = 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴
I'd spend MORE time on standards upfront.
The payoff is 10x.

𝟯. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗹𝗼𝗴𝘀 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗱𝗮𝘆 𝟭
Agents crash. Context is lost.
Start logging immediately.

𝟰. 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗯𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗲𝘀 𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗮𝗽
When testing is cheap, invest MORE in it.
Our 2:1 test ratio saved us constantly.

𝟱. 𝗛𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻 𝗷𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗴𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆
AI generates. You validate.
This never changes.

𝟲. 𝗜𝘁'𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀
It's about how you use them.
Skills > tools.

𝟳. 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗻𝗼𝘄
Every week you wait is compound learning lost.
The best time was 18 months ago.
The second best time is today.

12 weeks of content. 200K lines of experience.

What would YOU tell your past self?
