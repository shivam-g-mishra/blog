## CAPTION (Copy everything below the line)

---

From idea to production in 1 year (vs. 3-4 years traditionally).

Here's the exact 5-phase workflow we used at NVIDIA to ship 200K lines of code with 3 engineers.

## FIRST COMMENT (Post within 60 seconds)

📚 Want the detailed playbook?

Each phase has specific techniques:

**Phase 1 (Design):** Use AI for brainstorming, not just coding. Feed it your constraints.

**Phase 2 (Standards):** Ask AI to research best practices. Review and customize for your team.

**Phase 3 (Bootstrap):** Give AI ALL your standards. Let it create the project structure.

**Phase 4 (Roadmap):** Break everything into milestones. Make them trackable.

**Phase 5 (Build):** Maintain progress logs. Handle crashes gracefully.

Comment "WORKFLOW" and I'll share the detailed checklist!

### Slide 1 (Cover)
```
FROM IDEA TO PRODUCTION
IN 2 MONTHS

The 5-Phase AI Development
Workflow We Used at NVIDIA

200K lines • 3,248 tests • 3 engineers

[Swipe →]
```

### Slide 2
```
PHASE 1: DESIGN
Time: ~1 week

• Brainstorm with AI (Cursor + Gemini)
• Create design documents
• Technology comparison research
• Architecture definition
• API specifications

Key: Use AI for THINKING,
not just coding.
```

### Slide 3
```
PHASE 2: STANDARDS
Time: ~1 week

Ask AI to document:
• Coding guidelines
• Testing standards (we set 85%+)
• Documentation conventions
• CI/CD workflow
• Code structure expectations

Key: AI follows YOUR rules—
if you give it rules.
```

### Slide 4
```
PHASE 3: BOOTSTRAP
Time: ~1 day

Feed ALL documents to Cursor.

"Create a project following
these standards."

Result:
✓ Day 1 code quality
✓ Consistent structure
✓ No cleanup needed later
```

### Slide 5
```
PHASE 4: ROADMAP
Time: ~3 days

• Break into milestones
• Create implementation plans
• Define actionable items per feature
• Set measurable targets

Key: Plan THOROUGHLY before
asking AI to build.
```

### Slide 6
```
PHASE 5: BUILD
Time: ~6-7 weeks

Feature by feature:
• Reference the roadmap
• Implement with AI
• Maintain progress log
• Handle crashes gracefully

Key: The progress log is your
"save game" for AI development.
```

### Slide 7
```
THE SECRET SAUCE:
THE PROGRESS LOG

Every session:
✓ What's done
✓ Current status  
✓ What's next
✓ Decisions made

Agent crashes? Resume instantly.
Context lost? Never.
```

### Slide 8
```
THE RESULT:

✓ 200,000 lines of code
✓ 3,248 tests (2:1 ratio)
✓ 2 applications (Java + Go)
✓ 1 year total (3-4x faster)
✓ 3 engineers

Traditional timeline: 12-18 months
```

- **Size:** 1080x1350px (portrait gets more screen space)
- **Font:** Bold sans-serif, minimum 32pt for headers
- **Colors:** Dark background, light text (professional)
- **Accent:** Use green for checkmarks, yellow for emphasis
- **Tool:** Canva (free), Figma, or PowerPoint
- **Export:** PDF for LinkedIn carousel upload

## ENGAGEMENT TIPS

- Carousels get 3x engagement but need more time to perform
- Check every 2 hours instead of constantly
- Reply to "WORKFLOW" comments with DM or link
- Pin the first comment if possible
- Ask responders: "Which phase is your team strongest in?"

## EXPECTED QUESTIONS (Prepare answers)

**Q: Does this work for smaller projects?**
A: "The phases scale. For a small feature, you might spend 1 hour on each phase instead of days. The principle is the same."

**Q: What if I'm a solo developer?**
A: "Even better—you ARE the reviewer, so the bottleneck is just your own review capacity. The workflow still applies."

**Q: How long to create all the documentation?**
A: "With AI, maybe 2-3 days total. Traditional approach would be weeks. AI writes the first draft, you refine."
