# Post #1: The Flagship NVIDIA Story

## POST CONTENT (Copy everything below the line)

---

200,000+ lines of production code.
3,248 tests.
Countless pages of documentation.
3 engineers.
1 year.

A codebase that would traditionally take 3-4 years to build.

Here's what we shipped at NVIDIA:

→ API Server (Java Spring Boot): ~97K lines, 2,168 tests
→ Agent (Golang): ~104K lines, 1,080 tests
→ Design docs, architecture specs, API docs, client guides—all AI-assisted
→ CI/CD pipeline: Built in 1 day

All using Cursor + Claude + Gemini for the ENTIRE lifecycle:

1. Design documentation & architecture
2. Coding standards & best practices
3. Project bootstrap
4. Implementation roadmap
5. Feature-by-feature development
6. Client-facing documentation

The hardest part?

Keeping up with the REVIEW volume.

AI generated so much—code, tests, design docs, API specs, client guides—we couldn't review fast enough.

That's a problem I never expected to have.

What's the biggest project you've tackled with AI?

## FIRST COMMENT (Post within 60 seconds of main post)

📚 Here's the breakdown of our workflow over 1 year:

1. Design & Architecture (3-4 weeks): AI-assisted brainstorming, design docs, tech decisions
2. Standards (2 weeks): Coding guidelines, testing requirements, documentation conventions
3. Bootstrap (1 week): Project structure built from standards
4. Roadmap (1-2 weeks): Milestones, sprint planning, feature breakdown
5. Build (10+ months): Iterative feature development, continuous documentation

The key insight: Documentation FIRST, code SECOND.

We spent ~2 months on foundations before heavy coding.
That investment paid off 10x.

AI follows your standards—if you give it standards to follow.

Comment "WORKFLOW" if you want me to share the detailed playbook!

## EXPECTED QUESTIONS (Prepare answers)

**Q: What tools did you use specifically?**
A: "Cursor for day-to-day coding, Claude for complex features (better reasoning), Gemini for architecture discussions. Each has strengths—I'll post a comparison soon!"

**Q: How did you handle AI mistakes/bugs?**
A: "High test coverage (2:1 ratio) caught most issues. Plus we reviewed everything. AI generates, humans validate."

**Q: Is this realistic for smaller teams?**
A: "Absolutely—we were only 3 engineers actively coding. The key is the documentation-first approach. Give AI your standards, it follows them."

**Q: What about code quality?**
A: "That's why I shared the test numbers. 3,248 tests, 2:1 test-to-production ratio. We test MORE rigorously with AI, not less."
