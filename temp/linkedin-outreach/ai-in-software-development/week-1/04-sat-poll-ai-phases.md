Building with AI isn't just "ask AI to code."

Our NVIDIA project had 5 distinct phases:

1. Design & Architecture
2. Standards & Guidelines  
3. Project Bootstrap
4. Roadmap & Planning
5. Implementation

I'm curious—which phase do you find AI MOST helpful for?

## ENGAGEMENT TIPS

- Polls naturally drive engagement—less effort needed
- Thank people who comment with their specific approaches
- Ask follow-up questions to create threads:
  - "Which tools do you use for that phase?"
  - "What's the biggest challenge you face there?"
- Use results to inform Week 2+ content
- If "Implementation" wins, lean into tactical posts
- If "Design" wins, lean into architecture content
