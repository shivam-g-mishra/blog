"Observability is too expensive."

I hear this constantly.

But nobody calculates the cost of NOT having it.

Let me share what I've actually seen:

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗵𝗶𝗱𝗱𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗼𝘀𝘁𝘀:

→ 4-hour MTTR instead of 30 minutes
→ Engineers context-switching during incidents
→ Customer churn from repeated outages
→ On-call burnout and turnover
→ "War rooms" that drain entire teams

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗵:

One senior engineer costs ~$200/hour fully loaded.
A 4-hour incident with 5 engineers = $4,000.
Do that twice a month = $96,000/year.

In wasted debugging time alone.

That's before counting customer impact, reputation damage, or the engineers who quit because on-call was unbearable.

Good observability isn't an expense.
It's insurance against much bigger costs.

What hidden costs has your team experienced?

## FIRST COMMENT (Post within 60 seconds)

📚 I wrote about building cost-effective observability that actually pays for itself:

The key insight: Start with the fundamentals (metrics, logs, traces working together) before worrying about scale.

Most teams over-engineer on day one and under-invest in correlation.

## ENGAGEMENT TIPS

- This reframes the "observability is expensive" narrative
- Great for managers/directors who control budgets
- Ask follow-up: "Have you ever calculated your incident cost?"
- Share your own hidden cost stories in replies
