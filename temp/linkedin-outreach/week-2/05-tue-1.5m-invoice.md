The quote came back: $1.5 million.

Per year. For observability tooling.

At $25/node for infrastructure monitoring plus $12/node for APM, our 5,000+ data center nodes would cost us $1.5M annually.

Just to watch our own infrastructure.

That's when my team decided to build something different.

Today, our self-hosted observability stack costs ~$180K/year.
Same visibility. 88% cost reduction.

Here's what made the difference:

→ OpenTelemetry (vendor-neutral, future-proof)
→ Object storage (S3/MinIO for cheap retention)
→ Tail-based sampling (keep errors, drop noise)
→ Start simple (you don't need enterprise scale on day one)

The trade-off? You need infrastructure expertise.
But for teams where observability costs > 5% of infra spend, the ROI is compelling.

What's your observability stack costing you?

## FIRST COMMENT (Post within 60 seconds)

📚 I documented our entire architecture - from single-node to enterprise scale:

https://blog.shivamm.info/blog/scalable-observability-architecture?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=week2

It covers:
→ The 5-layer architecture we use
→ How we handle 50K+ events/sec
→ Exact tools and configurations
→ Cost breakdown at each scale tier

The repo is open-source too: https://github.com/shivam-g-mishra/opensource-otel-setup

## ALTERNATIVE HOOKS

**Alt 1:** "We were spending $1.5M/year on observability. Now we spend $180K."

**Alt 2:** "I saved my company over $1M annually. Here's how."

**Alt 3:** "The email that made me rethink everything about observability tooling."

## ENGAGEMENT TIPS

- This post tends to spark cost-sharing discussions
- Ask: "What's your biggest cost driver - storage, ingestion, or licensing?"
- Be prepared for vendor defenders - engage respectfully
- Share that open-source isn't for everyone (requires expertise)
