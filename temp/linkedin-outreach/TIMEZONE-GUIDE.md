# Posting Times by Timezone

Your schedule is optimized for Pacific Time (PT). Here's the conversion for other timezones.

## Primary Posting Schedule

| Post Type | PT (Los Angeles) | ET (New York) | GMT (London) | IST (India) | AEST (Sydney) |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Tue-Thu Posts** | 7:00 AM | 10:00 AM | 3:00 PM | 8:30 PM | 2:00 AM +1 |
| **Saturday Posts** | 8:30 AM | 11:30 AM | 4:30 PM | 10:00 PM | 3:30 AM +1 |

## Why Pacific Time Works

Your target audience (DevOps/SRE professionals) is heavily concentrated in:
- **US West Coast** (Silicon Valley, Seattle, LA) - Direct hit
- **US East Coast** - Mid-morning (10 AM) = peak LinkedIn time
- **Europe** - Afternoon (3 PM) = good for after-lunch browsing
- **India** - Evening (8:30 PM) = leisure browsing time

## If Your Audience is Primarily...

### US-Based
Stick with 7:00 AM PT (your current schedule).

### Europe-Based
Consider posting at 6:00 AM PT (2:00 PM GMT) to catch the European afternoon.

### India-Based
Consider posting at 5:30 AM PT (7:00 PM IST) for evening engagement.

### Global Audience
7:00 AM PT is a reasonable compromise that catches:
- US morning
- Europe afternoon
- India evening

## LinkedIn Algorithm Note

LinkedIn surfaces content based on when YOUR CONNECTIONS are active, not just when you post. If you have connections across timezones, LinkedIn will show your content when each person is active.

However, the first 2 hours of engagement are crucial for algorithmic boost. Posting when your PRIMARY audience is active gives you the best initial engagement, which then gets amplified globally.

## Tools for Scheduling

If you want to schedule posts:

1. **LinkedIn Native Scheduler** (Free)
   - Click "Schedule" when creating a post
   - Limited to 90 days in advance

2. **Buffer** ($6/month for 1 user)
   - More flexible scheduling
   - Analytics included

3. **Hootsuite** ($99/month)
   - Enterprise features
   - Team collaboration

## Recommendation

Start with the 7:00 AM PT schedule. After Week 4, check your LinkedIn Analytics to see when your audience is most active, then adjust if needed.

Your analytics will show:
- "When your followers are on LinkedIn"
- Geographic distribution of engagement

Use this data to optimize your posting times for Weeks 5-8.
