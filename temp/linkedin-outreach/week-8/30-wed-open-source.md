I open-sourced everything.

The complete observability stack my team uses:

📦 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁'𝘀 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲𝗱:

✓ Docker Compose configs
✓ Kubernetes manifests
✓ OpenTelemetry Collector configs
✓ Pre-built Grafana dashboards
✓ 30+ alerting rules
✓ Backup/restore scripts

🛠️ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸:

• Traces: Jaeger / Tempo
• Metrics: Prometheus / Mimir
• Logs: Loki
• Visualization: Grafana
• Collection: OpenTelemetry

🚀 𝗤𝘂𝗶𝗰𝗸 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁:

Clone the repo. Run "make up."
That's it. Full observability running in under 5 minutes.

Handles ~50K events/sec on single node.
Scales to unlimited with the enterprise configs.

Star it, fork it, improve it.
PRs welcome.
