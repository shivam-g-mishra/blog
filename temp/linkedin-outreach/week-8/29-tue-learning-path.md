"Where do I start with observability?"

I get this question weekly.

Here's the learning path I wish I had:

𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝟭: 𝗙𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗹𝘀 (Week 1-2)
→ Understand monitoring vs observability
→ Learn the three pillars (metrics, logs, traces)
→ Set up a local observability stack
→ Instrument a simple app

𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝟮: 𝗣𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀 (Week 3-4)
→ Learn OpenTelemetry basics
→ Practice structured logging
→ Create your first dashboard
→ Set up basic alerting

𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝟯: 𝗗𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲 (Month 2)
→ Distributed tracing in depth
→ SLOs and error budgets
→ Correlation across pillars
→ Sampling strategies

𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝟰: 𝗦𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲 (Month 3+)
→ High-availability architectures
→ Cost optimization
→ Advanced querying
→ Custom instrumentation

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗰𝘂𝘁:

Don't just read. Instrument something real.
Break it. Debug it. Learn from it.

Theory without practice is useless.

Where are you in your observability journey?
