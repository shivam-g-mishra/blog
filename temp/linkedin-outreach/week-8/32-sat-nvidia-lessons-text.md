5,000+ nodes.
Millions of requests daily.
Distributed across data centers.

Here's what I learned building observability at NVIDIA:

𝟭. 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲
We didn't build the five-layer architecture on day one.
Single-node handled more than we expected.

𝟮. 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴
Same labels. Same metric names. Same dashboards.
This enables powerful aggregations.

𝟯. 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗱𝗮𝘆 𝗼𝗻𝗲
Adding observability to existing systems is painful.

𝟰. 𝗙𝗲𝘄𝗲𝗿, 𝗯𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗮𝗹𝗲𝗿𝘁𝘀
We deleted 60% of our alerts.
Incidents got resolved faster.

𝟱. 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗧𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗿𝘆 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲
No vendor lock-in. One SDK everywhere.

𝟲. 𝗖𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲
$1.5M/year → $180K/year. Same visibility.

These lessons cost us time, money, and many sleepless nights to learn.

I hope they save you some of that pain.

What's the biggest lesson from your observability journey?

## FIRST COMMENT (Post within 60 seconds)

📚 I wrote the complete story of our observability journey:

https://blog.shivam.info/blog/observability-at-scale?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=week8

It covers:
→ How we started (and what we got wrong)
→ The scaling challenges we hit
→ Architecture decisions and trade-offs
→ What I'd do differently today

Plus: I open-sourced our entire stack:

8 weeks of content. Thank you for following along.

This is just the beginning. More coming.
