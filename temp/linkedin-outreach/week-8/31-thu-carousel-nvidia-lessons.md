5,000+ nodes
Millions of requests daily

What I learned

```

### Slide 2
```
LESSON 1:
START SIMPLE

We didn't build the 5-layer
architecture on day one.

Single-node handled more
than we expected.

Complexity comes later.
Start working now.
```

### Slide 3
```
LESSON 2:
STANDARDIZE EVERYTHING

Same labels.
Same metric names.
Same dashboards.

This enables powerful
aggregations across
5,000+ nodes.
```

### Slide 4
```
LESSON 3:
INSTRUMENT FROM DAY ONE

Adding observability to
existing systems is painful.

Retrofitting context
you didn't capture?
Impossible.

Day one. Not "later."
```

### Slide 5
```
LESSON 4:
FEWER, BETTER ALERTS

We deleted 60% of our alerts.

Result?
Incidents got resolved FASTER.

Noise is worse than silence.
```

### Slide 6
```
LESSON 5:
OPENTELEMETRY IS THE FUTURE

No vendor lock-in.
One SDK everywhere.
Switch backends without code changes.

We bet on OTel early.
No regrets.
```

### Slide 7
```
LESSON 6:
COST MATTERS AT SCALE

$1.5M/year → $180K/year
Same visibility.

At scale, small inefficiencies
become massive costs.

Optimize ruthlessly.
```

### Slide 8 (CTA)
```
THESE LESSONS APPLY
AT ANY SCALE.

Start with one.
Add as you grow.
