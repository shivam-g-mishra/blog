Datadog. New Relic. Splunk. Grafana Cloud. Honeycomb.
Or roll your own with open source.

The observability landscape is crowded.
And expensive.

I'm curious what this community actually uses ⬇️

## POLL QUESTION

## FOLLOW-UP COMMENT (Post after 50+ votes)

Interesting! Seeing a lot of [top option].

For those self-hosting: What made you choose that path?
For those using commercial: What features justify the cost?

I'd love to hear the reasoning behind your choices.
