## FIRST COMMENT (Post within 60 seconds)

📚 Want to go deeper? I wrote a comprehensive guide on the three pillars of observability:

https://blog.shivam.info/docs/observability/three-pillars?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=week1

It covers:
→ How traces, metrics, and logs work together
→ When you need each pillar
→ How to correlate data across all three

## CAROUSEL SLIDES (Create in Canva - 1080x1350px portrait)

### Slide 1 (Cover)
```
MONITORING vs OBSERVABILITY

What's the difference?
(And why it matters at 3 AM)

```

### Slide 2
```
MONITORING answers:

"Is CPU above 80%?"
"Did the health check pass?"
"Is the service up?"

Known questions.
Known answers.
```

### Slide 3
```
OBSERVABILITY answers:

"Why is checkout slow?"
"Which service caused the failure?"
"What's different about failing requests?"

Unknown questions.
Discovered answers.
```

### Slide 4
```
MONITORING is like a car dashboard:

✓ Speed
✓ Fuel level
✓ Engine temperature

You know SOMETHING is wrong.
You don't know WHAT.
```

### Slide 5
```
OBSERVABILITY is like a full diagnostic:

✓ Every component checked
✓ Error codes explained
✓ Root cause identified

You know EXACTLY what's wrong.
```

### Slide 6
```
THE THREE PILLARS:

📈 METRICS - What's the pattern?
🔍 TRACES - What's the journey?
📝 LOGS - What's the detail?
```

### Slide 7
```
WHEN YOU NEED OBSERVABILITY:

→ Requests cross service boundaries
→ Failures are intermittent
→ Scale makes direct inspection impossible
→ Context gets lost between services
```

### Slide 8 (CTA)
```
