"Everything is green!"

Meanwhile, customers are screaming.

Sound familiar?

This is the difference between monitoring and observability:

𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 answers: "Is CPU above 80%?"
𝗢𝗯𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 answers: "Why is checkout slow for users in Europe?"

Monitoring checks known failure modes.
Observability explores unknown unknowns.

The difference?

→ Hours of guessing vs. minutes of investigation
→ Dashboard hopping vs. hypothesis → evidence → root cause
→ "Probably the database" vs. "Line 142 in inventory-service"

For distributed systems where a user click touches 10 services?
You need observability.

Which approach does your team use today?

## FIRST COMMENT (Post within 60 seconds of main post)

📚 I wrote about why this distinction matters (and how to make the shift):

The short version: Monitoring tells you THAT something is wrong. Observability helps you understand WHY.

If you're still dashboard-hopping during incidents, this guide will help.

## ALTERNATIVE HOOKS

**Alt 1:** "Your dashboards are lying to you. Here's proof."

**Alt 2:** "The scariest words in incident response: 'All systems nominal.'"

**Alt 3:** "We had 47 dashboards. None of them showed the actual problem."

## ENGAGEMENT TIPS

- Great for debate - some will defend monitoring
- Engage with both sides respectfully
- Example reply: "Great point! At what scale did you find monitoring wasn't enough?"
