3 AM. Phone buzzes.

Then buzzes again.
And again.
17 alerts.

15 are noise.
2 are duplicates.
The real problem? Already self-healed.

You're wide awake.
Sleep isn't coming back.
Tomorrow's meeting? That's going to be rough.

𝗧𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝘀 𝗮𝗹𝗲𝗿𝘁 𝗳𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗴𝘂𝗲.

And it's worse than no alerts at all.

Why? Because your team learns to ignore alerts.
When the real incident comes, it gets lost in the noise.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝗶𝘅:

Every alert must answer YES to ALL of these:
✓ Does this require immediate human action?
✓ Is the impact clear and significant?
✓ Can the responder actually do something?
✓ Would I be okay being woken up for this?

If not? It's not an alert. It's noise.

𝗧𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲𝘁: < 2 pages per on-call shift

What's your alert-to-incident ratio?

## FIRST COMMENT (Post within 60 seconds)

📚 I wrote a complete guide on alerting - what to alert on, how to reduce noise, and SLO-based alerting:

https://blog.shivam.info/docs/observability/alerting?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=week5

Key sections:
→ The 4-question alert test
→ Alert severity levels
→ Grouping and deduplication
→ Runbook requirements
→ On-call health metrics

We deleted 60% of our alerts. Incidents got resolved faster.
