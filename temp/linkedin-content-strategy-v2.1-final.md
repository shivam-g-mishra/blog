## LinkedIn Profile Optimization (Do This First!)

Before posting, optimize your profile for conversions:

### Headline (Most Important)
**Current:** Senior Software Engineer @ NVIDIA
**Better:** Senior Software Engineer @ NVIDIA | Building observability systems at scale | Open-source advocate

### About Section (Include CTA)
```
I build observability systems that handle millions of requests at NVIDIA.

After seeing a $1.5M/year observability bill, I architected an open-source alternative that achieved 90% cost savings with the same visibility.

I write about:
→ OpenTelemetry and distributed tracing
→ Metrics, logging, and alerting at scale
→ Cost-effective observability architecture
→ Real production lessons (not theory)

📚 Free resources: blog.shivamm.info/docs/observability
🛠️ Open-source stack: github.com/shivam-g-mishra/opensource-otel-setup

Let's connect if you're working on observability, SRE, or distributed systems.
```

### Featured Section
Pin these (in order):
1. Your GitHub repo (opensource-otel-setup)
2. Fundamentals blog post
3. Best performing LinkedIn post (update monthly)

### Creator Mode
- Turn ON creator mode
- Add topics: Observability, DevOps, Software Engineering, OpenTelemetry, SRE

### Profile Photo & Banner
- **Photo**: Professional headshot, friendly expression, good lighting
- **Banner**: Create a custom banner with:
  - Your name + title
  - "Building observability at scale"
  - Your blog URL (blog.shivamm.info)
  - Use Canva (free LinkedIn banner templates)

## Hook Formulas That Stop the Scroll (NEW)

The first 1-2 lines determine whether people click "see more." Use these proven formulas:

### Formula 1: The Shocking Number
```
$150,000.
That was our monthly observability bill.
```

### Formula 2: The Contradiction
```
"Everything is green!"
Meanwhile, customers are screaming.
```

### Formula 3: The Time Stamp
```
3 AM. Phone buzzing.
17 alerts. 15 are noise.
```

### Formula 4: The Unpopular Opinion
```
Unpopular opinion: Most dashboards are useless.
Here's why →
```

### Formula 5: The Question
```
Why did this request take 8 seconds?
Every service looks healthy. Logs show nothing.
```

### Formula 6: The List Tease
```
6 lessons from building observability at NVIDIA:
(#4 saved us $1.3M/year)
```

### Formula 7: The Mistake
```
The biggest mistake I made with logging:
Treating it as an afterthought.
```

### Formula 8: The Before/After
```
Before observability: 3 hours to find root cause
After: 10 minutes
Here's what changed →
```

### Hook Power Words (Use These)
- "Here's what nobody tells you..."
- "The real reason..."
- "I was wrong about..."
- "Stop doing this..."
- "The hidden cost of..."
- "What I wish I knew..."

## Viral Content Patterns (NEW)

These formats consistently outperform regular posts:

### Pattern 1: The Numbered List
```
7 signs your observability is broken:

1. [Point]
2. [Point]
...

Which ones hit home?
```
**Why it works:** Scannable, shareable, drives comments ("I'm guilty of #3")

### Pattern 2: The Contrarian Take
```
Unpopular opinion: You don't need Kubernetes for observability.

Here's why most teams over-engineer →
```
**Why it works:** Sparks debate, drives comments (agree/disagree)

### Pattern 3: The Story Arc
```
[Situation] → [Complication] → [Resolution] → [Lesson]

Example:
$1.5M invoice → Built alternative → 90% savings → Lessons learned
```
**Why it works:** Humans are wired for stories

### Pattern 4: The Comparison
```
Monitoring vs Observability:

Monitoring: [point]
Observability: [point]

(repeat 4-5 times)
```
**Why it works:** Easy to understand, highly shareable

### Pattern 5: The "I Was Wrong"
```
I was wrong about [thing].

For years, I thought [old belief].
Then [experience happened].
Now I know [new belief].
```
**Why it works:** Vulnerability builds trust + credibility

### Pattern 6: The Hot Take Thread
```
Hot take: [Controversial statement]

But wait—here's the nuance:

[Point 1]
[Point 2]
[Point 3]

What do you think?
```
**Why it works:** Drives engagement through debate

### The 10-3-1 Rule
From each major blog post, create:
- **10** potential hooks/angles
- **3** LinkedIn posts (different angles)
- **1** carousel

---

## Recovery Tactics: When Posts Flop (NEW)

Not every post will perform. Here's what to do:

### If a Post Gets Low Engagement (< 500 impressions)

**Don't:**
- Delete it (looks bad)
- Post again immediately
- Get discouraged

**Do:**
- Analyze why (weak hook? wrong time? too niche?)
- Engage heavily with others' content (resets algorithm)
- Wait full 24 hours before next post
- Try the same topic with a different hook later

### Common Reasons Posts Flop

| Reason | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| Weak hook | Rewrite with formula from above |
| Too technical | Add relatable story |
| Posted at wrong time | Stick to Tue-Thu 7-8 AM |
| No engagement question | Always end with question |
| Didn't engage before posting | Do the 30-min routine |

### The Recovery Post
After a flop, your next post should be a "safe" format:
- Poll (always gets engagement)
- Story post (3 AM nightmare type)
- Contrarian take (drives comments)

---

## Advanced Growth Tactics (NEW)

After Week 4, add these to accelerate growth:

### 1. LinkedIn Live (Monthly)
- Topic: "Ask Me Anything: Observability"
- Promote 1 week in advance
- Go live for 30-45 minutes
- Repurpose into 3-4 posts

### 2. LinkedIn Audio Events
- Lower barrier than video
- "Coffee Chat: Debugging War Stories"
- Invite 2-3 connections to co-host

### 3. Collaborative Articles
- LinkedIn suggests topics based on your expertise
- Contribute to 2-3 per week
- Shows your expertise to new audiences

### 4. The Featured Comment Strategy
When you leave a great comment on a viral post:
- Screenshot it
- Post: "I left this comment on [person]'s post about [topic]..."
- Expand on your point
- Tag the original poster

### 5. Cross-Platform Amplification
- Share LinkedIn wins on Twitter/X
- "This post hit 10K views on LinkedIn..."
- Drives Twitter followers to LinkedIn

---

## The 30-Minute Pre-Posting Routine (Critical!)

**Do this EVERY TIME before posting:**

LinkedIn's algorithm rewards users who engage before posting. This 30-minute routine can 2-3x your reach:

### 15 Minutes Before Posting:
1. **Engage with 10 posts** in your niche:
   - Find posts using #Observability, #OpenTelemetry, #SRE, #DevOps
   - Leave **thoughtful comments** (not just "Great post!")
   - Like and save interesting posts

2. **Comment on 3 influencer posts:**
   - Kelsey Hightower (Kubernetes/DevOps)
   - Liz Fong-Jones (Observability)
   - Charity Majors (Observability)
   - Austin Parker (OpenTelemetry)
   - Follow OpenTelemetry, CNCF, Grafana Labs pages

3. **Reply to any comments** on your previous posts

### Immediately After Posting:
1. **Add blog link as FIRST comment** (within 30 seconds)
2. **Respond to EVERY comment** in first 2 hours
3. **Like comments** as they come in
4. **Share to relevant groups** (if you're in any)

## Revised Post Format (Critical Updates)

### The Winning Structure

```
[HOOK - 1-2 lines that stop the scroll]

[STORY - 3-4 lines, personal and relatable]

[VALUE - 5-7 lines with clear takeaways]

[CTA - Question to drive comments]

---
[3-4 hashtags max]

💡 Link in first comment
```

### Critical Rule: Links Go in Comments

**Why:** LinkedIn's algorithm reduces reach by 30-50% when posts contain external links.

**How:**
1. Post content WITHOUT links
2. Immediately add first comment with: "📚 Full guide: [link]"
3. Reply to your own comment to bump it

---

## CTA Variations That Drive Comments (NEW)

Don't always ask the same question. Rotate these CTAs:

### Experience-Based CTAs
- "What's your worst 3 AM debugging story?"
- "Has this happened to you?"
- "What would you add to this list?"

### Opinion-Based CTAs
- "Agree or disagree?"
- "What's your take?"
- "Am I wrong about this?"

### Choice-Based CTAs
- "Which approach does your team use?"
- "What's your biggest challenge: A, B, or C?"
- "Where do you fall on this spectrum?"

### Action-Based CTAs
- "Drop a 🔥 if you've experienced this"
- "Comment 'GUIDE' and I'll send you the full resource"
- "Tag someone who needs to see this"

### Engagement Hack: The Double CTA
End posts with TWO calls to action:
```
What's your biggest observability challenge?

(And if you want the full guide, comment "GUIDE" 👇)
```

## Revised Posts (Top 10 Most Important)

### POST 1: The 3 AM Nightmare (Week 1, Tuesday)
**Format:** Text | **Length:** 1,150 chars

```
3 AM. Phone buzzing.

Elevated error rates on checkout.
Dashboards show "everything is green."
But orders are failing.

Is it the database? Payment gateway? Network?

I've been in this exact situation.
Without proper observability, you're diagnosing a car problem by staring at the "check engine" light.

Here's what changed everything for me:

1. Saw error spike in metrics (narrowed the timeframe)
2. Filtered logs for that window (found "connection pool exhausted")  
3. Clicked through to the trace (saw N+1 query bug)
4. Root cause: slow query from yesterday's deployment

𝟭𝟬 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝘂𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗿𝗼𝗼𝘁 𝗰𝗮𝘂𝘀𝗲.

Without it? Still guessing at 5 AM.

What's your worst 3 AM debugging story?

#Observability #SRE #DevOps

💡 Link in comments
```

**First Comment (post immediately):**
```
📚 I wrote a complete guide on how metrics, traces, and logs work together to make this possible:

[YOUR BLOG LINK]

The three pillars are: Traces (follow the journey) + Metrics (spot patterns) + Logs (get details)
```

### POST 2: Everything is Green (Week 1, Wednesday)
**Format:** Text | **Length:** 1,050 chars

```
"Everything is green!"

Meanwhile, customers are screaming.

Sound familiar?

This is the difference between monitoring and observability:

𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 answers: "Is CPU above 80%?"
𝗢𝗯𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 answers: "Why is checkout slow for users in Europe?"

Monitoring checks known failure modes.
Observability explores unknown unknowns.

The difference?

→ Hours of guessing vs. minutes of investigation
→ Dashboard hopping vs. hypothesis → evidence → root cause
→ "Probably the database" vs. "Line 142 in inventory-service"

For distributed systems where a user click touches 10 services?
You need observability.

Which approach does your team use today?

### POST 3: Monitoring vs Observability Carousel (Week 1, Thursday)
**Format:** Carousel (PDF) | **Slides:** 8-10

#### Carousel Design Guidelines (NEW)
**Tools:** Canva (free), Figma, or PowerPoint
**Size:** 1080x1080px (square) or 1080x1350px (portrait - gets more screen space)
**Font:** Bold, readable (minimum 24pt for body text)
**Colors:** Consistent brand colors throughout
**Each slide:** ONE main idea, minimal text

**Slide 1 (Cover):**
```
MONITORING vs OBSERVABILITY

What's the difference?
(And why it matters at 3 AM)
```

**Slide 2:**
```
MONITORING answers:
"Is CPU above 80%?"
"Did the health check pass?"
"Is the service up?"

Known questions.
Known answers.
```

**Slide 3:**
```
OBSERVABILITY answers:
"Why is checkout slow?"
"Which service caused the failure?"
"What's different about failing requests?"

Unknown questions.
Discovered answers.
```

**Slide 4:**
```
MONITORING is like a car dashboard:
✓ Speed
✓ Fuel level
✓ Engine temperature

You know SOMETHING is wrong.
You don't know WHAT.
```

**Slide 5:**
```
OBSERVABILITY is like a full diagnostic:
✓ Every component checked
✓ Error codes explained
✓ Root cause identified

You know EXACTLY what's wrong.
```

**Slide 6:**
```
THE THREE PILLARS:

📈 METRICS - What's the pattern?
🔍 TRACES - What's the journey?
📝 LOGS - What's the detail?
```

**Slide 7:**
```
WHEN YOU NEED OBSERVABILITY:

→ Requests cross service boundaries
→ Failures are intermittent  
→ Scale makes direct inspection impossible
→ Context gets lost between services
```

**Slide 8 (CTA):**
```
Want the complete guide?

Comment "GUIDE" and I'll send you my
free observability documentation.

### POST 4: The $1.5M Invoice (Week 2, Tuesday)
**Format:** Text | **Length:** 1,200 chars

```
The invoice landed on my desk: $150,000.

For ONE month of observability tooling.

At $25/node for infrastructure monitoring plus $12/node for APM, our 5,000+ data center nodes would cost us $1.5M annually.

Just to observe our own infrastructure.

That's when my team decided to build something different.

Today, our self-hosted observability stack costs ~$15K/month.
Same visibility. 90% cost reduction.

Here's what made the difference:

→ OpenTelemetry (vendor-neutral, future-proof)
→ Object storage (S3/MinIO for cheap retention)
→ Tail-based sampling (keep errors, drop noise)
→ Start simple (you don't need enterprise scale on day one)

The trade-off? You need infrastructure expertise.
But for teams where observability costs > 5% of infra spend, the ROI is compelling.

What's your observability stack costing you?

### POST 5: Poll - Debugging Frustration (Week 1, Saturday)
**Format:** Poll | **Duration:** 1 week

**Question:**
```
What's your biggest frustration when debugging production issues?
```

**Options:**
1. Can't reproduce the issue
2. Logs don't have enough context
3. Takes too long to find root cause
4. Too many false alerts

**Post text above poll:**
```
I've spent countless hours debugging production issues.

Some investigations take 10 minutes.
Others take 10 hours.

The difference? Usually the quality of observability data.

Curious what frustrates you most ⬇️
```

### POST 6: Three Pillars Carousel (Week 2, Thursday)
**Format:** Carousel (PDF) | **Slides:** 10

**Slide 1 (Cover):**
```
THE THREE PILLARS
OF OBSERVABILITY

Traces • Metrics • Logs
(How they work together)
```

**Slide 2:**
```
PILLAR 1: TRACES

Follow a single request through
your entire distributed system.

User click → 10 services → Response

See exactly where time was spent.
```

**Slide 3:**
```
TRACE EXAMPLE:

User clicks "Buy Now" (850ms total)
├── API Gateway (15ms)
└── Order Service (800ms)
    ├── Inventory Check (450ms) ← SLOW
    │   └── DB Query (430ms) ← FOUND IT!
    └── Payment (300ms)
```

**Slide 4:**
```
PILLAR 2: METRICS

Numerical measurements over time.

Request rate: 1,234/sec
Error rate: 0.02%
P99 latency: 450ms

See patterns across millions of requests.
```

**Slide 5:**
```
THE GOLDEN SIGNALS:

1. Latency - How long?
2. Traffic - How much?
3. Errors - How often failing?
4. Saturation - How full?
```

**Slide 6:**
```
PILLAR 3: LOGS

Discrete events with context.

BAD: "ERROR: Payment failed"

GOOD: {
  "error": "card_declined",
  "user_id": "123",
  "trace_id": "abc"
}
```

**Slide 7:**
```
THE POWER: CORRELATION

Alert fires (metrics)
     ↓
Search logs (context)
     ↓
Examine trace (root cause)

10 minutes to resolution.
```

**Slide 8:**
```
WITHOUT CORRELATION:

"Something is wrong."
"Maybe the database?"
"Let me check 5 dashboards."
"Still guessing after 2 hours."
```

**Slide 9:**
```
WITH CORRELATION:

"Error rate spiked at 10:15"
"Logs show connection pool exhausted"
"Trace shows N+1 query bug"
"Fixed in 15 minutes."
```

**Slide 10 (CTA):**
```
Want the complete guide?

I wrote 10,000+ words on each pillar.

### POST 7: Why Your Logs Are Useless (Week 4, Tuesday)
**Format:** Text | **Length:** 1,100 chars

```
"ERROR: Payment failed for user"

Great.
Which user?
Which payment?
Why did it fail?

This log helps no one at 3 AM.

Here's the difference:

𝗕𝗮𝗱 𝗹𝗼𝗴:
ERROR Payment failed

𝗚𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗹𝗼𝗴:
{
  "error": "card_declined",
  "user_id": "usr_456",
  "trace_id": "abc123",
  "duration_ms": 234
}

Now I can:
✓ Query all failures for this user
✓ Jump to the distributed trace
✓ See exactly what went wrong
✓ Correlate with other events

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝘂𝗹𝗲𝘀:

1. Structured JSON (not strings)
2. Always include trace_id
3. Add business context
4. Use log levels correctly
5. Never log secrets

What's the worst log message you've seen in production?

### POST 8: Alert Fatigue (Week 5, Tuesday)
**Format:** Text | **Length:** 1,150 chars

```
3 AM. Phone buzzes.

Then buzzes again.
And again.
17 alerts.

15 are noise.
2 are duplicates.
The real problem? Already self-healed.

You're wide awake.
Sleep isn't coming back.
Tomorrow's meeting? That's going to be rough.

𝗧𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝘀 𝗮𝗹𝗲𝗿𝘁 𝗳𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗴𝘂𝗲.

And it's worse than no alerts at all.

Why? Because your team learns to ignore alerts.
When the real incident comes, it gets lost in the noise.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝗶𝘅:

Every alert must answer YES to ALL of these:
✓ Does this require immediate human action?
✓ Is the impact clear and significant?
✓ Can the responder actually do something?
✓ Would I be okay being woken up for this?

If not? It's not an alert. It's noise.

𝗧𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲𝘁: < 2 pages per on-call shift

### POST 9: Open Source Announcement (Week 8, Wednesday)
**Format:** Text | **Length:** 1,100 chars

```
I open-sourced everything.

The complete observability stack my team uses:

📦 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁'𝘀 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲𝗱:

✓ Docker Compose configs
✓ Kubernetes manifests  
✓ OpenTelemetry Collector configs
✓ Pre-built Grafana dashboards
✓ 30+ alerting rules
✓ Backup/restore scripts

🛠️ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸:

• Traces: Jaeger / Tempo
• Metrics: Prometheus / Mimir
• Logs: Loki
• Visualization: Grafana
• Collection: OpenTelemetry

🚀 𝗤𝘂𝗶𝗰𝗸 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁:

git clone [repo]
make up

That's it. Full observability running.

Handles ~50K events/sec on single node.
Scales to unlimited with the enterprise configs.

Star it, fork it, improve it.

### POST 10: NVIDIA Lessons (Week 8, Saturday)
**Format:** Text | **Length:** 1,200 chars

```
5,000+ nodes.
Millions of requests daily.
Distributed across data centers.

Here's what I learned building observability at NVIDIA:

𝟭. 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲
We didn't build the five-layer architecture on day one.
Single-node handled more than we expected.

𝟮. 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴
Same labels. Same metric names. Same dashboards.
This enables powerful aggregations.

𝟯. 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗱𝗮𝘆 𝗼𝗻𝗲
Adding observability to existing systems is painful.

𝟰. 𝗙𝗲𝘄𝗲𝗿, 𝗯𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗮𝗹𝗲𝗿𝘁𝘀
We deleted 60% of our alerts.
Incidents got resolved faster.

𝟱. 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗧𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗿𝘆 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲
No vendor lock-in. One SDK everywhere.

𝟲. 𝗖𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲
$1.5M/year → $180K/year. Same visibility.

What's the biggest lesson from your observability journey?

## Hashtag Strategy (Updated)

### Use 3-4 Hashtags Max (Algorithm prefers fewer)

**Tier 1 - Always include ONE:**
- #Observability (153K followers)
- #DevOps (4.8M followers)

**Tier 2 - Rotate based on topic:**
- #SRE (89K followers)
- #OpenTelemetry (growing niche)
- #CloudNative (287K followers)

**Tier 3 - Niche discovery:**
- #DistributedSystems
- #Prometheus
- #Grafana
- #Kubernetes

**Language-specific (when relevant):**
- #Golang, #Python, #Java, #DotNet

### Hashtag Placement
Put hashtags BELOW a line separator:
```
[Your post content]

---
#Observability #DevOps #SRE
```

---

## Engagement Amplification Tactics

### 1. The Comment Strategy
For your first 4 weeks, comment on these accounts daily:
- @opentelemetry (official)
- @grafaboratory (Grafana)
- @cikiorg (CNCF)
- Any posts with #Observability hashtag

**Quality comment formula:**
```
[Agree/Add context] + [Your experience] + [Question or insight]

Example:
"This is spot on. We saw the same issue at scale - 
connection pool exhaustion is almost always an N+1 query 
hiding somewhere. Have you tried adding tracing to catch 
these before they hit production?"
```

### 2. The Reply Hook
When someone comments on your post, reply with a question:
```
"Thanks! What observability stack are you using currently?"
"Great point - have you dealt with this at scale?"
```

This creates threads, which LinkedIn loves.

### 3. The Repost Strategy
Once a week, repost someone else's observability content with your take:
```
This ⬇️

[Reposted content]

I'd add one thing: [your insight]

What do you think?
```

### 4. Tag Strategically
When mentioning tools, tag the company pages:
- "Using @Grafana for dashboards..."
- "OpenTelemetry Collector by @opentelemetry..."

They sometimes reshare, giving you massive reach.

## Analytics Interpretation Guide (NEW)

### Understanding LinkedIn Analytics

**Where to find:** Your profile > Analytics (or Post > View analytics)

### What Each Metric Actually Means

| Metric | What It Tells You | Good Benchmark |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Impressions** | How many feeds your post appeared in | 500+ (new account), 2K+ (established) |
| **Engagement Rate** | (Reactions + Comments + Shares) / Impressions | 3-5% (good), 8%+ (viral) |
| **Click-through Rate** | Profile visits / Impressions | 1-2% |
| **Dwell Time** | How long people spent reading | (Hidden, but affects reach) |

### Reading the Engagement Breakdown

```
Your post performance:
├── Impressions: 5,000
├── Reactions: 150 (3% - good)
├── Comments: 45 (0.9% - excellent)
├── Reposts: 12 (viral indicator)
└── Clicks: 200 (4% - high intent)
```

**What matters most:** Comments > Reposts > Reactions > Impressions

### Red Flags in Analytics

| Signal | What It Means | Fix |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| High impressions, low engagement | Hook works, content doesn't deliver | Improve value section |
| Low impressions overall | Algorithm isn't pushing your content | More pre-posting engagement |
| Lots of reactions, few comments | Content is "nice" but not discussable | Add controversial take or question |
| High comments, low follows | People engage but don't want more | Make bio/profile more compelling |

### The 48-Hour Rule
LinkedIn posts get 80% of their engagement in the first 48 hours. After that:
- Stop monitoring obsessively
- Focus on next post
- Use learnings for future content

## Summary: The Non-Negotiables

If you do nothing else, do these 5 things:

1. **Links in comments, not posts** - This alone can double your reach

2. **30-minute engagement routine before every post** - Algorithm rewards active users

3. **Strong hooks using proven formulas** - First line determines everything

4. **End every post with a question** - Comments are the #1 signal to LinkedIn

5. **Post consistently on Tue/Wed/Thu** - Consistency beats perfection

---

**Remember:** Consistency beats perfection. Post on schedule even if you're not 100% happy with the content. You can always improve based on what resonates.

The goal: By Week 8, you should have:
- 500+ new followers in your niche
- 100+ weekly clicks to your blog
- Established authority in observability space
- A repeatable content system

Start Tuesday. Post the 3 AM Nightmare story. Watch what happens.

Ship it. 🚀
